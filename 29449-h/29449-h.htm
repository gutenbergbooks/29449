<p>How many of us inwardly feel a secret longing to find God; and
this usually accompanied by the perception that we are confronted by an
impenetrable barrier&mdash;we cannot find Him&mdash;we can neither go through this barrier
nor climb over it! We have faith. We are able to admit that He exists, for we
cannot help but perceive a Will dominating the laws of the Universe; but
something deep within us that we cannot put a name to, something subtle, secret,
and strange, cries aloud, &quot;But I need more than this, it is not enough; I need
to personally find and know Him. Why does He not permit me to do so?&quot;</p>
<p>We might easily answer ourselves by remembering that if, in everyday life, we greatly desire to see a friend, our best way of doing
so is by going in the direction in which he is to be found: we should consider
this as obvious. Then let us apply this, which we say is so obvious, to God. We
waste too much time looking for Him in impossible directions and by impossible
means. He is not to be found by merely studying lengthy arguments, brilliant
explanations of theological statements, or controversies upon the meanings of
obscure dogmas. He is not even to be found through organising charity concerts
and social reforms however useful. We shall find Him through a self stripped
bare of all other interests and pretensions&mdash;stripped bare of everything but a
humble and passionately seeking <i>heart</i>.</p>

<p>He says to the soul, &quot;Long for Me, and I will show Myself.
Desire Me with a great desire, and I will be found.&quot;</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Scattered all through history are innumerable persons, both
great and insignificant, who looked for the Pearl of Great Price: and not too
many would seem to have found it. Some sought by study, by intelligence; some by
strict and pious attention to outward ceremonial service; some by a &quot;religious&quot;
life; some even by penance and fasting. Those who found sought with the heart.
Those who sought with careful piety, or with intelligence, found perhaps faith
and submission, but no joy. The Pearl is that which cannot be described in
words. It is the <i>touch of God Himself upon the soul, </i>the Joy of Love.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>The entrance to the land of happiness and peace is through union
of the will to Christ, by love. How can this sense of love be reached? By
centring the wheel of the mind, with its daily spinning thoughts, upon the Man
Jesus, and learning to inwardly see and hold on to the perfect simplicity and love of Jesus
Christ. We can form the habit of taking Jesus as our heart and mind companion.
We are all aware of the unceasing necessity of the mind to fill itself: we
cannot have <i>no </i>thoughts until we have advanced in the spiritual life to a
long distance. We may well see, in this, one of the provisions made by God for
His own habitation in the mind of man&mdash;a habitation too often hideously usurped
by every kind of unworthy substitute. Petty social interests and occupations,
personal animosities, ambitions, worries, a revolving endless chaos of
futilities, known and praised by too many of us as &quot;a busy life&quot;!&mdash;the mind
being given opportunity only at long intervals, and usually at stated and set
times, to dwell upon the thought of God, and the marvellous future of the human
spirit. We are like travellers who, about to start out upon a great journey,
pack their portmanteaus with everything that will be <i>perfectly useless to them</i>!</p>

<p>Now, it is possible to put out and obliterate this chaotic and
useless state of mind, which would appear to be the &quot;natural mind,&quot; and to open
ourselves to receive the might and force and the joys and delights of Christ's
Mind. These joys are the Heart of Christ speaking to the heart of His lover.
They are incomparable: beyond all imagination until we know them; and we receive
them and perceive them and enjoy them as we have largeness and capacity to
contain them. For there is no end. He has ever more to give if we will be but
large enough to receive.</p>
<p>We are too absorbed in the puerile interests and occupations of
daily life. We make of these endless occupations a virtue. They are no virtue,
but a deadly hindrance, for they keep us too busy to look for the one thing
needful&mdash;the Kingdom of God. What is this world? It is a schoolhouse for lovers, and we are lovers in the making.</p>
<p>Is baptism of itself sufficient to get us into this Kingdom? No.
Is the leading of an orderly social life sufficient to find it? No. Is the hope,
even the earnest expectation, that we shall, by some means or other (we do not
know by what!), be brought to it, sufficient to find it? No; not without the <i>
personal laying hold </i>can we ever achieve it. Shall we find it in much
outward study? No; and our aim is, not to be the student but the possessor; and
the key to this possession is not in books, but, for us, in Jesus. He it is who
must be invited and admitted into the heart with great tenderness&mdash;with all those
virtues for which He stands&mdash;and made the centre point of thought. Out of
constant thought grows tenderness; out of tenderness, affection; out of
affection, love. Love once firmly fixed in the heart for Jesus, we get a
perception (by contrast) of our own faults&mdash;very painful, and known as repentance. This should be succeeded
at once by change of mind, <i>i.e. </i>we try to push out the old way of
thinking and acting and take on a new way. We try, in fact, strenuously to
please the Beloved, to be in harmony with Him; and now we have established a
personal relationship between ourselves and Christ.</p>
<p>With the perception of our own failings comes the necessary
humility and the drastic elimination of all prides. We remember, too, that
although Jesus is so near to us, and our own Beloved, He is also the mighty Son
of God.</p>
<p>He is also the mystical Christ, who, when we are ready, leads us
to the Father: which is to say, that we are suddenly stricken with the
consciousness of and the love for God; and here we enter that most wonderful of
all earthly experiences&mdash;the Soul's great Garden of Happiness.</p>
<p>To be a student of theories, dogmas, laws, and writings of men is to be involved in endless
controversy; and we may study books till we are sick, and embrace nothing but
vapour for all our pains. To be a pupil and possessor we must first establish
the personal relationship between ourselves and Jesus. To do this we must
realise more fully than we now do that He <i>still lives. </i>The mind is
inclined to dwell on Him mostly as <i>having lived. </i>When we have taught
ourselves to realise that Jesus is as intensely alive to everything that we do
as He was when He visibly walked with men&mdash;that Jesus is as easily aware of our
inmost thoughts and endeavours now as He was of the secret thoughts of His
disciples,&mdash;then we shall have brought Him much closer into our own life.</p>
<p>As the possessor of life is not the student of schools, but is
the pupil of Christ, let us prepare ourselves to be pupils; and this again we do
solely by the help of the Man-Jesus, who is in Christ, and Christ in Jesus. For the Christ-God is at first too
strong a meat for us: we cannot with fullness understand that He is God, but He
Himself will teach us this when we are ready to know it. To know this truth in
its fullness is already to possess eternal life.</p>
<p>As no man is able to give us eternal life, so no man is able to
give us the knowledge that Christ is God, as He willed to reveal Himself to man.
If we have doubts which hurt, let us drop them out, changing the thought quickly
to the sweetness, simplicity, and gentleness of the Man-Jesus. If we have
questionings, let us cease to question, and say with the man of old, &quot;Lord, I
believe; help Thou mine unbelief.&quot;</p>
<p>We do well to avoid these questionings, pryings, and
curiosities, for when we indulge in such things we are like that common servant
who does not disdain to peep through the keyhole of his master's chamber! Let us
put such spiritual vulgarities upon one side, and, opening our heart
to lovely Love, take Him as our only guide. Love draws us very rapidly to His
own abiding-place, for we are made of love, and because of love, and for love,
and to Love we must return, for He awaits us with longing.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>We often think, Where am I at fault? I am unable to <i>see </i>
myself as a sinner, though publicly I confess myself to be one. For I keep the
commandments; I am friendly to my neighbours; I am just to my fellow-men; I can
think of no particular harm that I do. Why, then, am I a sinner? And our very
modesty and reverence may forbid us to compare ourselves with God. Yet here lies
our mistake; for if we would enter the Garden of Happiness and Peace, which is
the Kingdom of God, this is the commencement of our advance&mdash;that we should
compare ourselves in all things with God, in whose likeness we are made, and, making such full observation as we are
able of the terrible gulfs between ourselves and Him, should with tears and
humility and constant endeavour be at great pains and stress to make good to Him
our deficiencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Be ye perfect as I am perfect.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Be ye holy as I am holy.&quot; </p>
<p>If
this were not attainable, He would not have set so high a goal. In this, then,
we are sinners&mdash;that we are not pure and lovely as God Himself! This is a
prodigious, an almost unthinkable height; yet He wills us to attempt it, and all
the powers of Heaven are with us as we climb.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Fear curiosity. Fear it more than sin. Curiosity is the root,
and sin the flower. This is one of the reasons why we should never seek God
merely with the intelligence: to do so is to seek Him, in part at least, with
curiosity. God will not be peeped upon by a curious humanity. The indulgence in curiosity would of itself explain the whole downfall, so called,
of man.</p>
<p>The Soul is the Prodigal. Curiosity <i>to know </i>led her away
from the high heavens. Love is her only way of return.</p>
<p>Curiosity is the mother of all infidelity, whether of the spirit
or of the body.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Though on reading the Gospels carefully we may be unable to come
to any other conclusion than that Jesus Christ neither prayed for nor died for
all mankind, but only for the elect, yet we see equally clearly that all mankind
is <i>invited to be the elect. </i>We are, then, not individually sure of heaven
because Jesus died upon a cross for men; but sure of heaven for ourselves, only
if we individually will to live and think and act in such a manner that <i>we
become of the elect</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;Him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out,&quot; says the
Voice of the Beloved.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>In our early stages, how we shrink from the mere word, or idea,
of perfection; and later, what we would give to be able to achieve it! Yet
though we shrink so from the thought of it, we know instinctively that we must
try to approach it; if we would stay near Him, we must be wholly pleasing to
Him. We think of saints&mdash;we know nothing of saints, but think of them as most
unusual persons midway between men and angels, and know ourselves not fashioned
for any such position: and how change ourselves, how alter our character, as
grown men and women?</p>
<p>It is Christ who can show us the way.</p>
<p>The Water of Life is the Mind of Christ, and the true object of
life is to learn how to receive this Mind of Christ: for by it and with it we
enter the Kingdom of God. And how shall we receive the Mind of Christ? Here is
our difficulty. Firstly, we may do it through sympathy with, and a drawing near to, the Man-Jesus, accompanied by such drastic changes of
mind as we are able to accomplish <i>to show our goodwill. </i>We may learn to
become more unselfish, more patient, more sympathetic to others, and to curb the
tongue, so that words which are untrue or unkind shall not slip off it. We can
learn to govern the animal that is in us, instead of being governed by it. No
one could have a better guide in how to improve the condition of his mind than
Aaron Crane's book, <i>Right and Wrong Thinking</i>.</p>

<p>And next, having become well knitted to the Man-Jesus, the
Christ will draw us forward step by step through all the next inward stages, we
giving to Him our attention; and He will bring us finally to that marvellous
condition of God-consciousness by which He is able to perpetually refresh and
renew us. There is one great first rule to hold to, which is <i>to think
lovingly of Jesus</i>: in this way we eventually and automatically <i>come into
a state of love. </i>In which state He will teach us to put
out our own little light, that we may learn to live by the lovely light of God.
And we have entered the Kingdom!</p>
<p>For myself, I experienced three conversions: the first two of
terrible suffering, and the third of great and marvellous joy, in which it is no
exaggeration to say that for a few moments I seemed to receive God and all the
freedom of the Heavens into my soul. I am not able to say exactly how long this
experience lasted, for I was dead to time and place, but I should judge it to
have been from fifteen to twenty minutes.</p>
<p>The first conversion came upon me one afternoon in my room, as I
came in from walking. I had been thinking of Jesus while I walked, as I was
often in the habit of doing. Without any intention or premeditation on my part,
I was now suddenly overwhelmed by a most horrible, unbearable, inexplicable pain
of remorse for my vileness: for I seemed suddenly to be aware of Him standing
there in His marvellous purity and looking at me&mdash;not with any reproach, but
with the sweetness of a wonderful Invitation upon His face. And immediately I
saw myself utterly unworthy to come near Him: and I writhed in the agony of this
fearful perception of my unworthiness till I could bear no more. I was sick and
ill with remorse and regret, I was utterly broken up by it. I did not know then
that this awful pain is what is known as repentance, and wondered secretly what
could have come to me. After this I found myself far more constantly thinking of
Jesus&mdash;exchanging, as it were, sweet confidences with Him, telling Him what I
thought, and endeavouring in every possible way to follow His manner of thought.
I am ashamed to say I was very remiss and lazy in prayers; upon my knees I
prayed very little indeed. But I was very faithful and warm and tender to Him in my heart, and this had an effect upon my mind and actions,
and continued for two years.</p>
<p>I would be assailed by many questionings during this time. For
instance, how could my sweet Jesus, whom I was always so near to, be the mighty
Christ and God? But I dropped these out as they came, feeling myself altogether
too small to understand these things, and very much frightened by such
greatnesses.</p>
<p>When I was alone with Jesus, all was so simple and so lovely; so
I put away all other thoughts and held closely to Jesus.</p>
<p>This having continued almost exactly the two years, upon Easter
morning, at the close of the service, the horrible anguish came on me again as I
knelt in the church. I was not able to move or to show my face for more than an
hour; and to this day I am not able to dwell upon the memory of that awful pain,
for I think I should go mad if I had to enter again into so great a torture of the spirit. I endured to
the utmost limit of my capacity for suffering&mdash;for this I will say of myself, I
did not draw back, but went on to the bitter end. And the suffering was caused
by the sight of that most terrible of all sights: the vision of myself as over
against the vision of Jesus Christ, and I died a death for every fault. Whoever
has felt the true wailing of the soul, such an one knows the heights of all
spiritual pain. The heart and mind, or creature, suffers in depths; but the soul
in heights, and this at one and the same time, so that the pain of repentance is
everywhere. And the depth of the suffering of the creature is coequal with the
height of the suffering of the soul, and the joint suffering of both would seem
to be of coequal promise and merit for their after joy and glory; so that it
would seem that the more horrible our pain, the quicker is our deliverance and
the greater our later joys.</p>
<p>After this, Jesus, without my knowing how it came about, passed
out from the Perfect Man into the Christ of God. I walked and talked with Him no
longer just as sweet Jesus, but as the Marvellous and Mighty Risen Lord! And now
I became far more changed. The world and all earthly loves began to fade; they
no longer satisfied or filled me in the least. How could I contemplate His
exquisite perfections, the ineffable beauties of His mind and heart, and,
turning from these to the sight of the world and of the men and women that I
knew, not feel the difference? Where among my friends could I find perfect love?
Amongst husbands and wives? No. Amongst mothers and children? No. For everywhere
I saw discord, secret selfishness, separate and divided desires, and many
deceits. I found no love anywhere like His for us. I was always an epicure in
the matter of love, and knew the best when I found it. I continued with my social and home life exactly as
before: the change was an inward change.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after this the war came, and, with it,
torments of anxiety over my earthly loves.</p>
<p>The fearful anxieties I was in drove me to prayer. I began to
pray more regularly; but though I prayed, I remained as miserable as before. A
painful illness came, and lasted four months. I had no home because of the war,
and nowhere to be ill in peace: and I drank and ate wretchedness as my daily
bread and wine, and wondered why I ever was born.</p>
<p>I cannot recall I was ever rebellious. No, I never was. I walked
in a maze of trouble, and endured like a poor dumb thing, <i>and did not throw
out my heart to God enough </i>in prayer. If I had done this I think I should
have been through my pains in half the time.</p>
<p>Two years went by, and, being in greater anxiety than ever
because of a great battle that was going on and my love at the front of it,
I went up on the hill where I often went, and standing there I contended with
God, crying out, &quot;It is too much&mdash;the pain of this war is too great and too long;
I cannot bear it. I am at an end of everything. Help me! Help me!&quot; And in my
anguish I seemed at last to be melted and running like water before Him, and I
came before Him as it were immediately before a mighty and living Presence,
though I saw nothing.</p>
<p>But though I was so near Him and appealed to Him with the whole
of my strength, there was no answer, no reply, but the great silence of heaven.</p>
<p>At last, my agony over, I walked for a little, very quiet and
very sad, and all at once a marvellous thing happened to me. I will not here
describe how it was done to me, but He filled me with love for Himself, an
amazing, all-absorbing, and tremendous love&mdash;from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet I was filled with love. And this was His
answer&mdash;and all my sorrows fled away in a great joy.</p>
<p>This third conversion produced a fundamental alteration of my
whole outlook and grasp on life. It brought me into direct contact with God, and
was the commencement of a total change of heart and mind and consciousness; the
centre of my consciousness, without any effort of my own, suddenly moving bodily
from a concentration upon the visible or earthly to a loving and absorbed
concentration upon, and a fixed attention to, the Invisible God&mdash;a most amazing,
undreamed-of change, which remained permanent, though fluctuating through
innumerable degrees of intensity before coming to a state of equilibrium. And
now Christ went away from me, so that I adored Him in God. After this for some
weeks I went through extraordinary spiritual experiences, the like of which had
never previously so much as entered into my heart to imagine; again I will say nothing here of these. I came to all
these experiences with great innocence and ignorance, never having read any
religious or psychological book, and I think now that it is perhaps easier to
have it so.</p>
<p>Knowing that nothing is done without a purpose, I would question
myself what I could possibly be intended to learn out of these things; and
though I have never yet found a reason for any one given experience, yet I see
this: the whole (which lasted for some weeks and was gone through at night and
always in a state of semi-wakefulness, though not in a normal wakefulness, for
the body would be stiff and set like a board)&mdash;the whole was the most convincing
proof that He could have given me (without destroying my flesh) of the reality
of the life unseen. For how otherwise could we be made to know of the reality of
spiritual things if we were never <i>taken into </i>them? And having been taken into them, and they being a thousand times more
poignant than any earthly experience, how could we forget them? Whenever doubts
upon anything presented themselves, I had nothing more to do than to Remember!
Nothing He could have devised to do for me could have been of greater or more
direct assistance to me. These experiences were to my creature what the
centre-board is to the racing yacht. With these memories I could keep an even
keel, and without them I must have capsized many a time.</p>
<p>By these spiritual experiences He gives us an immense courage,
and personal knowledge of a mysterious and hitherto unknown life of joys so
great and so intense that all sufferings endured by us here appear to us in
their true light as being a melting and cleansing agency infinitely worth while,
that we may gain in permanence such exquisite felicity.</p>
<p>Our means of reaching a personal experience, whilst still in the body, of such a life of joys is
to harmonise the spirit of our human creature to the degree of purity required
by the soul to enable her in unfettered freedom to perform her divine functions.</p>
<p>We confuse in our minds the two separate essences&mdash;that of the
soul and that of the human spirit (heart, intelligence, and will), which are
widely different; the soul acting for us as the wings of the creature. And above
and superior to the soul, and yet within it, is the divine and incorruptible
Spirit or Sparkle of God, which in its turn acts as the wings of the soul. So we
have the worm (or creature-spirit), the soul; and the Celestial Spark, or Divine
Intelligence of the soul, which is the organ of God, and with which we are able
to come in <i>sensible contact </i>with the divine world and God Himself. What
are our enemies? Selfishness, impatience, covetousness, pride, ill-temper,
bodily indulgences, and, above all, indifference to God of the will of the creature.</p>
<p>After this third, and last, conversion upon the hill, which so
altered my whole life, I was for a period of some months in such a state of
exaltation and enhancement of all my faculties that I did not know myself at
all. I was, without any intention or endeavour on my own part, suddenly become
like a veritable House of Arts! The most beautiful music flowed through my mind,
in which I noticed certain peculiarities&mdash;there was no sadness in it, and it
swayed me so that I seemed to go into a state of white-heat with emotion over
it. It was extraordinarily much smoother than any earth-music I ever heard, and
extremely consecutive, like a fluid. Now with earth-music I find that even
Wagner is not able to achieve any consecutive perfection: he reaches to a
height&mdash;only to fall back and disappoint. But this other music, which is not
heard with the senses but is invariably felt by the soul, remains at extreme and fluid
perfection, and casts such spells over the listener that he is beside himself
with enjoyment. Colour and form, imagery of all kinds, would pass through me
till I felt like an artist, and cried out with regret, &quot;Oh, if I had only
studied this or that art and knew the grounding of it, what heights of
proficiency I could reach now!&quot; An object of quite ordinary charm seemed,
because of that something which now filled me, to expand into prodigious beauty!
The very pavements and houses, mean and hideous as they are, overflowed with
some inexplicable glamour. The world was turned into a veritable paradise! When
I thought of it all I was filled with amazement, and still am, for how can we
explain such changes in manner of living and seeing? At this time my only
trouble or difficulty was to conceal my condition from others. </p>
<p>But this
wonderful state of things gradually passed away, and I went into a most difficult
condition. At one time of the day I would be in an ecstasy of delight, and an
hour later in some altogether unreasonable depth of wretchedness. I went to and
fro from one extreme to the other, and my time was, I think, mostly spent in
trying to regain some kind of balance. My love for God was as great as ever, but
it had become a love all made of tears. Indeed, my whole being seemed made of
tears. I thought often of these words, the peace of God; most certainly I had
not found it. On the contrary, my life had become an indescribable turmoil. I
found no help from my fellow-beings; I seemed to have lost the power of talking
pleasantly with them, and my point of view had become different from theirs. Men
could no longer please me, and I could not please God! I was entirely alone
spiritually, and I said to myself it would be better if I could be alone
physically as well; and I ached and longed and dreamed of solitude till it was like a sickness.
But the only solitude I could have was in my own room.</p>
<p>Now, believing myself to be a sensible and practical person, I
would say to myself that my condition, being so unreasonable, must be got out
of, and I must make every effort to do it. I prayed for two things&mdash;that I might
love God with a cheerful countenance and not with tears, and that He would teach
me quickly what to pray for; and He gave me the impulse to pray for more and
greater love.</p>
<p>Next, I banished my own feelings as much as I could (since love
must not think of itself), paying as little attention to them as possible by
perpetually dropping them out as they came and returning to the thought of
Jesus, concerning myself at all times of the day to loving inward conversation
with Him; and in this manner I fastened myself closer than ever to Him,
continually praying for greater love to give Him and passionately offering Him all that I
already had, whilst with all my will and strength I tried to climb out of my
miserable state. Soon I succeeded&mdash;I was out of it in a matter of weeks.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>How humanity is extolled by its own kind! How men are admired,
even glorified! I am amazed, for where is the glory of any man? But rather, how
wonderful and glorious is God! that He should cause to spring from one handful
of dust such possibilities! Wonderful God! And blessed man, that he should have
so wonderful a God!</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Some men say that man has invented for himself the thought of
God, because of the great need he feels within himself for such a Being.</p>
<p>Yet look where we will in Nature, do we find a warrant for such
a thought? Are babes inspired with the desire for milk, and is that milk withheld from the nature of all mothers?
No; to the babe is given the desire because the mother has wherewith to satisfy.
So with grown men: for to us is given a deep and secret desire for the milk of
God's love, and to Himself He has reserved the joy of leading us to it and
bestowing it upon us.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Sometimes for a short while the soul will suffer from a sickness
(I speak now for persons already very well advanced); she is parched and without
sweetness. Her love has no joy in it. This is not a condition to be accepted or
acquiesced in, but must be overcome at once by a remedy of prayer: prayer
addressed to the Father, <i>in the name of Jesus Christ, </i>a prayer of praise
and adoration&mdash;&quot;I praise and bless and love and thank Thee, I praise and bless
and love and worship Thee, I praise and bless and love and glorify Thee&quot;&mdash;till
the heart is fired and we return to the intimacy of love. Or the Lord's Prayer, very slow, and with an intention both outgoing
and <i>intaking. </i>So far I have never known these remedies to fail, and joy
floods the soul and sends her swinging up, up, on to the topmost heights again.
It is magnificent.</p>
<p>How is it that we can pass so, up from the visible into the
Invisible, and become so oned with it, and feel it so powerfully, that the
Invisible becomes a thousand times more real to us than the visible! It is like
a different manner of living altogether. And when anyone so living finds himself
even for a short time unfastened from this way of living and back again to what
is known to the average as normal life, this normal life seems no better to him
than some horrible chaotic and uneven turmoil, and his brain ready to be turned
if he had to remain in it for long. When so unfastened, the whole savour of life
is completely gone, and a smallness of mind and outlook is fallen back into from which the soul recoils in horror and struggles quickly to
free herself.</p>
<p>Is this the remnant of the unruly creature rising up and
grappling with the soul again? Is this some deliberate trial of us by the
Master? or some natural spiritual sickness? Whilst in this condition we must
disappoint the Beloved. On the other hand, we find ourselves kept to the
knowledge of our own impotence and nothingness and dependence, and the spirit is
strengthened by the efforts made quickly to recover the lost beautiful estate.</p>
<p>Also we become more able to feel true patience and compassion
for such others as do not know the way of escape. So we gain, maybe, more than
we lose.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>We may wonder how it is that the Mighty Maker of the Universe
should choose to condescend to the mere individual piece of clay. It is
incomprehensible. It is so incomprehensible that there is but one way of looking at it. This is no
favouritism to the individual, but the evidence of a Mind with a vast plan
pursuing a way and using a likely individual. These individuals or willing souls
He takes and, setting them apart, fashions them to His own ends and liking. Of
one He will make a worker, and of another He fashions to Himself a lover. It
would seem to be His will to use the human implement to help the human. As
water, for usefulness to the many, must be collected and put through channels,
so it would seem must the beneficence of God be collected into human vessels and
channels that it may be distributed for the use of the many and the more feeble.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>The more any man will consider humanity, the more he will see
that the education of the heart and will is of more importance than the
education of the brain. For in the perfectly trained and educated heart and will we find the evidence of highest wisdom.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Why mortify the body with harsh austerities? When we
over-mortify the body with fastings, pains, and penances we are <i>remembering
the flesh. </i>Let us aim at the forgetting and not the despising of the flesh.
A sick body can be a great hindrance to the soul. By keeping the body in a state
of perfect wholesomeness we can more easily pass away from the recollection of
it. Chastise the mind rather than the body. Christ taught, not the contempt or
wilful neglect of the body, but the humble submission of the body to all <i>
circumstances, </i>the obedience of the will to God, and the glorious and
immeasurable possibilities of the human spirit.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>We know that the love of the heart can be beautiful and full of
zeal and fervour; but the love of the soul by comparison to it is like a
furnace, and the capacities of the heart are not worthy to be named in the
same breath. Yet, deplorable as is the heart of man, it is evidently desired by
God, and must be given to Him before He will waken the soul. To my belief, we
are quite unable to awaken our own soul, though we are able to <i>will </i>to
love God with the heart, and through this we pass up to the border of the Veil
of Separation, where He will <i>sting the soul into life </i>and we have
Perception.</p>
<p>After which the soul will often be swept or plucked up into
immeasurable glories and delights which are neither imagined nor contrived, nor
even desired by her at first&mdash;for how can we desire that which we have never
heard of and cannot even imagine? And these delights are unimaginable before the
soul is caught up into them, and to my experience they constantly differ. The
soul knows herself to be in the hands and the power of another, outside herself. She does not enter these joys of her own power or of her own
will, but by permission and intention and will of a force outside herself though
perceived and known inside herself. No lovers of arguments or guessing games can
move the soul to listen when she has once been so handled. For to know is more
than to guess.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>How can a Contact with God be in any way described? It is not
seeing, but meeting and fusion with awareness. The soul retaining her own
individuality and consciousness to an intense degree, but imbued with and fused
into a life of incredible intensity, which passes through the soul vitalities
and emotions of a life so new, so vivid, so amazing, that she knows not whether
she has been embraced by love or by fire, by joy or by anguish: for so fearful
is her joy that she is almost unable to endure the might of it. And how can the
heat or fire of God be described? It is very far from being like the cruelty of
fire, and yet it is so tremendous that the mind knows of little else to compare
it to. But it is like a vibration of great speed and heat, like a fluid and
magnetic heat.</p>
<p>This heat is of many degrees and of several kinds. The heat of
Christ is mixed with indescribable sweetness: giving marvellous pleasure and
refreshment and happiness, and wonderfully adapted to the delicacy of the human
creature. The heat of the Godhead is very different, and sometimes we may even
feel it to be cruel and remorseless in its very terrible and swift intensity.
But the soul, like all great lovers, never flinches or hangs back, but
passionately lends herself. If He chose to kill her with this joy she would
gladly have it so.</p>
<p>By these incomprehensible wonders He seems to say to the
creature: &quot;Come thou here, that I may teach thee what is Joy; come thou here,
that I may teach thee what is <i>Life. </i>For none are permitted to
teach of these things save I Myself.&quot;</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>There is another manner. The Spirit comes upon the soul in waves
of terrible power. Now in a rapture God descends upon the soul, catching her
suddenly up in a marvellous embrace: magnetising her, ravishing her. He is come,
and He is gone. In an ecstasy the soul goes out prepared to meet Him, seeking
Him by praise and prayer, pouring up her love towards Him; and He, condescending
to her, fills her with unspeakable delights, and at rare times He will catch her
from an ecstasy into a greater rapture. At least, so it is with me: the ecstasy
is prepared for, but in the quicker rapture (or catching up) it is He that seeks
the soul. These two conditions, though given very intermittently, become a
completely natural experience. I should say that the soul lived by this way: it
is her food and her life, which she receives with all the simplicity and naturalness of the
hungry man turning to his bodily food. But these waves of power were something
altogether new and very hard to endure. As each wave passed I would come up out
of it, as it were, gasping. It was as if something too great for the soul to
contain was being forced through her. It was as if one should try to force at
fearful pressure fluid through a body too solid to be percolated by it. I
understood nothing of what could be intended by such happenings, neither could I
give accommodation to this intensity. I tried to make myself a wholly willing
receptacle and instrument, but after the third day of this I could not bear any
more. I was greatly distressed. I could not understand what was required of me.
I gave myself totally to Him, and it was not enough. And at last I cried to Him,
saying: &quot;I understand nothing: forgive me, my God, for my great foolishness, but
Thy power is too much for me. Do what Thou wilt with me; I am
altogether Thine. Drown me with Thy strength, break me in pieces&mdash;I am willing;
only do it quickly, my Lord, and have done with it, for I am so small. But I
love Thee with all that I have or am; yet I am overwhelmed: I am still too
little to be taught in this way, it is too much for my strength. Yet do as Thou
wilt; I love Thee, I love Thee.&quot; And He heard me, and He ceased: and He returned
to the ways that I understood and dearly loved, and for weeks I lived in
Paradise. But my body was dreadfully shaken, and I suffered with my heart and
breathing.</p>
<p>Shortly after I began to know that another change had come into
me. God had become intensely my Father, and Christ the lover was gone up again
into the Godhead&mdash;as happened after my third conversion upon the hill.</p>
<p>So great, so tremendous was this sense of the <i>Fatherhood </i>
of God become that I had only to think the word Father to seem to be instantly
transported into His very bosom. Oh, the mighty sweetness of it! But it is not
an ecstasy. The creature and soul are dead to world-life, as in a rapture or
ecstasy; but the soul is not the bride, she is the child, and, full of eager and
adoring intimacy, she flies into His ever-open arms, and never, never does she
miss the way. Oh, the sweetness of it, the great, great glory of it, and the
folly of words! If only all the world of men and women could have this joy! How
to help even one soul towards it is what fills my heart and mind. How convince
them, how induce them to take the first steps? It is the first steps we need to
take. He does not drive, He calls. &quot;Come to Me,&quot; He calls. It is this failure to
have the will to go to Him which is the root of all human woe. Would we but take
the first few steps towards Him, He will carry us all the rest of the way. These
first few steps we take holding to the hand of Jesus. For the so-called
Christian there is no other way (but he is no Christian until he has taken it).
For the Buddhist, doubtless, Gautama is permitted to do the same. But for those
who are baptized in Jesus Christ's name, He is their only Way.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>God, once found, is so poignantly ever-present to the soul that
we must sing and whisper to Him all the day.</p>
<p>O marvellous and exquisite God! I am so enraptured by Thy
nearness, I am so filled with love and joy, that there is no one, nothing, in
heaven or earth to me save Thine Own Self, and I could die for love of Thee!
Indeed I am in deep necessity to find Thee at each moment of the day, for so
great is Thy glamour that without Thee my days are like bitter waters and a
mouthful of gravel to a hungry man. How long wilt Thou leave me here&mdash;set down
upon the earth in this martyrdom of languishing for love of Thee? And suddenly, when the pain can be endured no more, He
embraces the soul. Then where do sorrow and waiting fly? and what is pain? There
never were such things!</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>We do well never to recall past ecstasies. In this way the soul
comes to each encounter with a lovely freshness and purity, and neither makes
comparisons nor curious comments, but gives herself wholly to love. But by these
contacts the soul gains a secret and personal knowledge of God: without sight
and without reasoning she actually feels to partake of God, so that she passes
by these means far up beyond belief, into experiences of knowledge which in
their poignant intensity are at once an ineffable violence and a marvellous
white peace.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>I find the lark the most wonderful of all birds. I cannot listen
to his rhapsodies without being inspired (no matter what I may be in the midst of doing or saying) to throw
up my own love to God. In the soaring insistence of his song and passion I find
the only thing in Nature which so suggests the high-soaring and rapturous
flights of the soul. But I am glad that we surpass the lark in sustaining a far
more lengthy and wonderful flight; and that we sing, not downwards to an earthly
love, but upwards to a heavenly.</p>
<p>To my mind, this is man's only justification for considering
himself above the beasts&mdash;that we can love, and communicate with, God. For where
otherwise is his superiority? He builds fine buildings which crumble and decay.
He digs holes in the earth to take out treasures which he has not made; and if
he makes himself the very highest tower of wealth or fame, he must come down
from it and be buried in the earth like any other carcase.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>It is better not to contend, either with others or against our
own body. If we contend against anything we impress it the more firmly upon our
consciousness. So if we would overcome the lusts of the body, let us do it not
by harming or by contending against the body, which but emphasises its powers
and importance, but let us rather proceed to ignore and make little of the body
by forgetting it and passing out of it into higher things; and eventually we
shall learn to live, not in the lower state, but in the joy of the soul. Why
have a contempt for the body? I once did, and found that I was committing a
great sin against the Maker of it.</p>
<p>How dare we say &quot;my body is vile,&quot; when He fashioned it! It is
blasphemous, when we consider that it is His Temple.</p>
<p>To my mind the body is a beautiful and wonderful thing, and is
greatly sinned against by our evil hearts and minds and tongues. The body would do no harm if we, with our free-will, did not think out the
wickedness first in our own hearts. For first we commit theft and adultery with
the mind, and then we cause the body to carry out these things. We know that the
body is under the law, and its appetites are under the law, but the heart and
mind and tongue are perpetual breakers of this law. It is lawful for the body to
take its meat and drink, but not to be surfeited and drunken. It is lawful for
the body to have its desires and its loves, but not to be promiscuous and
unfaithful.</p>
<p>But we know that a better way is to turn all appetites and
greeds to this, that we be greedy and ravenous for Christ. Only so shall we use
the appetites of mind and heart and body for their true end, and that not by
despising but by conversion.</p>
<p>With great insistence I have been taught not to despise anything
whatever in Creation of <i>things made </i>in His most beautiful and wonderful
world, though often I may cry with tears, &quot;Lord God! raise me to a
world holier and nearer to Thyself, for I am heartbroken here.&quot;</p>
<p>Yet I am taught only to despise such things as lying,
deceitfulness, hypocrisy, and uncleanness&mdash;in fact, stenches of the heart and
mind,&mdash;and not to think too much about these, but, passing on, drop out the
recollection of them in thoughts of finer things.</p>
<p>His inward instruction has been this, quietly to lay upon one
side all that which is not pleasing to God; and one by one, and piece by piece,
to fold up and put away all that He does not love.</p>
<p>Above all, He has taught me to have no self-esteem and no
prides; and to such a degree do I have to learn this, that, without the smallest
exaggeration, I am hardly ever able to think myself the equal of a dog. But the
love of a dog for his master is a very fine thing.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>I think we mistake our own power and capacity in even seeking to
imitate the Christ; let us begin rather by taking into our heart and our mind
the Christ as the Man-Jesus. For His love and power only can show us the way to
imitate the Christ which is in Him.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Is the temporary loss of grace our fault, or is it a deliberate
withdrawal and testing upon His part? Both. Every condition that we are in which
is not pure and perfect of its kind, such as pure peace, pure joy, pure harmony,
is because of failure on our part to <i>hold </i>to Him. Whenever, and for so
long, as we keep ourselves in the single and simple condition of mind and heart
necessary for the perception and reception of Him, for just so long shall we
receive and perceive him; but this condition again we cannot maintain without
grace. All loss of joy, of serenity, of contact, is failure, then, on our part
or withdrawal upon His. Yet we learn a bitter but useful lesson by these losses of
ability for connection. To return ignominiously to our dust is a most bitter
humiliation and trial&mdash;indeed, a desolation. Now, if we did not so return we
might suppose ourselves able, of our own power, not only to achieve momentary
connection with the Divine, but to remain at will in this sublime condition, by
which I mean in a state bordering upon ecstasy. The withdrawal of grace
therefore would seem to be a necessary part of the education and of the constant
humbling of the soul. To find ourselves, of our own unaided capacity, by the
mere force of our own will, able to constantly go up to so high a level would
inevitably foster pride; indeed, to attain such a capacity would seem to place
us on a level with the angels!</p>
<p>By these withdrawals of grace, which came at first very
tenderly, but gradually with greater and greater severity, I have learnt this: that in spite of all that has been
done for me, of all that I have experienced, in spite of all the heights to
which at times I have been raised, I remain nothing better than the frailest and
unworthiest thing! The sight of an ugly grey cloud, momentarily and gloriously
illumined by the sun, is a sufficient illustration of the temporary
transformation of our own selves touched by the light and the glory of God.</p>
<p>For the carrying out of His plan, it would seem to be His good
pleasure that we are just what we are&mdash;not angels, but little human things, full
of simplicity and trust and love. &quot;Like dear children,&quot; as St Paul says; and
yet, oh! wonder of wonders! <i>far more than this. </i>For whilst we patiently
wait, from time to time He stoops and embraces the soul in an infinite bliss, in
which we are no more children, but are caught up into High Love.</p>
<p>At first when we begin this new kind of living He holds us
firmly, as it were, to a condition suitable for contact with Him. If He did not
do so, having had no previous practice, we should never remain in it for two
moments together. Then little by little He teaches us to live with less frequent
joy, and this is the cause of much difficulty and trouble. It is hard to endure
being without this blessed state and these marvellous favours, and more and more
I found He withdrew them whilst often my worldly and commonplace heart and mind
still held me back&mdash;<i>even from peace. </i>If we could but rid ourselves quickly
of all selfish desires and greeds! Not until I had learnt to do this was I given
back my joys, and then sparingly.</p>
<p>How I would turn towards that secret door&mdash;the door of the
kingdom of love,&mdash;and calling to Him, hear no reply! Where is He gone?&mdash;why this
desertion?&mdash;I would cry. How can He cause such pain, how can I bear such dreadful deprivations,
and what is love but a sharp sword? Lord, let me hear Thy voice, for I am in
despair; I cannot bear these pains, I fear for everything, my joy is lost. My
bread is spread with bitterness; where is the honey that I love so well? Lord,
call to me even from far away, and I shall hear and be consoled. Lord, I am sick
and ill&mdash;how canst Thou leave me so? Hast Thou no pity for my pain?&mdash;is this Thy
love? <i>My </i>pain! Lord, I remember! Thou hast been kissed by pain more
frequently than I. Oh, let me wipe the memory of Thy pain away with my warm
love, and let me sing to Thee and be Thy lark, and do Thou go and wander where
Thou wilt and I will love Thee just the same! And softly the Voice of the
Beloved, saying: &quot;I am here, I never left thee; but thou wast busy crying of thy
pains and did not hear Me when I answered thee.&quot; Lord, so I was! I was so filled
with self, and, asking for <i>Thy gifts, I did forget to give! </i>and so
lost love.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>It is hard to conquer in small things, petty irritations,
worries, cares of this world, likes and dislikes&mdash;all of these being subtle
temptations, and all selfish. For instance, very often I find the human voice
the most horrible thing that I know! I will be in a beautiful state of mind, and
people around me will drag me from it with their maddening inanities of
conversation. This one will speak of the weather, and that one of food; another
of scandal, another of amusements. They will talk of their love for a dog, for a
horse, for golf, for men or women; but never do I hear at any time, or anywhere,
anyone speak of their love for God. I must listen to all their loves, but if I
should venture to speak of mine they would look at me amazed; indeed, I never
should dare to do it. And this is perhaps the greatest weakness that I have to fight against now, and one that spoils the harmony of the mind
more than any other&mdash;that I cannot always control myself from secret though
unspoken irritation, impatience, and criticisms; and to criticise is to judge,
and in this there is wrong, and the smallest breeze of wrong is enough to
blow to&mdash;even to close&mdash;the door into that other lovely world. And not only this,
but every such failure is a disappointment to the Beloved. Many times I say to
Him, &quot;What canst Thou do with us all, Beloved&mdash;such a mass of selfish, foolish,
blundering, sinful creatures, all hanging and pulling on to Thee at the same
moment?&quot; And I will be filled with a passionate desire to so progress that I
may stand a little alone and not be a perpetual drag upon Him, and, feeling
strong, perhaps I will say: &quot;I will give up my share of Thee to someone else,
and not draw upon Thee for a little while, my Beloved Lord.&quot; But oh, in less
than an hour, if He should take me at my word! I could cry and moan like a small child, in my horrible
emptiness and longing for Him. And where now is my strength?&mdash;I have not an ounce
of it without Him! By this I learn in my own person how He is life itself to us,
in all ways. He is the air, the bread, and the blood of the soul, and no one can
live without at every moment drawing upon Him, though they do it insensibly.
What a weight to carry, what a burden, this whole hungry clamouring mass of
disobedient men and women! Oh, my Beloved, how frequently I weep for all Thy
bitter disappointment&mdash;never ending!</p>
<p>But this we may be sure of&mdash;that all the marvels of His grace are
not poured out on some poor scrappit for no other reason than to give him
pleasure. There is a vast purpose behind it all, and by keenest attention we
must pick up this purpose, understand it, <i>and do it. </i>This is the true
work of man, to love God with all the heart and mind and soul and strength, and not those material
works with which we all so easily satisfy ourselves and our consciences, and our
<i>bodily </i>needs.</p>
<p>He has marvellous ways (and very difficult to the beginner) of
conveying His wishes. To my finding, the inward life of us is like a perpetual
interchange of conversation between the heart and its many desires and the mind
(which for myself I put into three parts&mdash;the intelligence, the will, the
reason). Now, all these parts of my heart and of my mind formerly occupied
themselves entirely with worldly things, passing from one thing to another in
most disorderly fashion; but now they occupy themselves (save for bodily
necessities) <i>solely </i>with Him. There is a perpetual smooth and beautiful
conversation between them <i>to </i>Him and <i>of </i>Him; and suddenly He will
seem to enter into this conversation, suggesting thoughts which are not mine.</p>
<p>Often He will stab the soul, but not with words, also the heart;
and I have known such communications lie for weeks before they could be taken up
by the mind, turned into words, and finally as <i>words </i>be digested by the
reason. And another way to the soul only&mdash;rare, untransferable to words, and
therefore not transmittable to others or to the reason. This way causes the
creature a great amazement, and is like a flooding or moving of whiteness, or an
inwardly-felt phosphorescence; it is a vitalising ministration greatly enjoyed
by the soul. This is not any ecstasy, and is exceedingly swift; the soul must be
at <i>high attention </i>to receive this, yet neither anticipates nor asks for
it, but is in the act of giving great and joyful adoration.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>I do not remember when I first became fully conscious that the
centre or seat of my emotions was changed, and that I now responded to all the experiences of life only with the higher parts of me.</p>
<p>This change I found inexplicable and remarkable, for it was
fundamental, and yet neither intended nor thought of by me. With this alteration
in the physical correspondences to life came a corresponding alteration in the
spiritual of me.</p>
<p>Formerly I supposed that the soul dwelt in, or was even a part
of, the mind. Now, though the mind must be filled wholly with God, and all other
things whatsoever put out of it if we would contemplate Him or respond to Him,
yet neither the brain nor the intelligence of the creature can come into any
contact with Him; and this I soon learnt.</p>
<p>Correspondence with the Divine is accomplished for the creature
through the heart and by the uppermost part of the breast, this latter place
(above the heart and below the mind) is the dwelling-place of the celestial
spark of the soul, which lies, as it were, between two fires&mdash;that of the heart and that of the mind,
responding directly to neither of these, but to God only.</p>
<p>Before I was touched upon the hill I was not aware of the
locality of any part of my soul, neither was there anything which could convince
me that I even possessed a soul. I did no more than believe and suppose that I
did possess one. But the soul, once revived, becomes the most powerful and vivid
part of our being; we are not able any longer to mistake its possession or
position in the body. She is indeed the wonderful and lovely mistress of us,
with which alone we can unlock the mysteries of God's love.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>How poor and cold a thing is mere belief! No longer do I <i>
believe </i>in Jesus Christ: I do <i>possess Him. </i>So complete is the change
that He brings about in us that I now only count my life and my time from the
first day of this new God-consciousness that I received upon the hill, for
that was the first day of my real life; just as formerly I would count my time
from the first day of my physical birth, and from that on to my falling in love
and to my marriage, which once seemed to me to be the most important dates.</p>
<p>Whilst these changes were taking place in me I would often be
filled with uneasiness and some alarm; asking myself what all this could mean,
and if it could be the way of martyrs or saints, for I had no courage or liking
to be one or the other and was very frightened of suffering. And I think my
cunning heart would have liked to take all the sweets and leave the bitter. How
well He knew this, and how exquisitely He handled me, never forcing, only
looking at me, <i>inviting </i>me with those marvellous perfections of His! How
could I possibly resist Him? All the while, all my waking hours, I felt that
strange, new, incomprehensible, steady, insistent <i>drawing </i>and
urgency of the Spirit in me. Little by little I went&mdash;and still go&mdash;<i>towards </i>
perfection, whilst my cowardly heart endured many fears, but these are now past.
It was not any desire for my own salvation; to this I have never given so much
as two thoughts. It was the <i>irresistible attraction </i>of our marvellous and
beautiful God. He lured, He drew me with His loveliness, His holy perfections,
His unutterable purity. <i>I longed to please Him. </i>The whole earth was
filled with the glamour of Him, and I filled with horror to see how utterly
unlike&mdash;apart from the glorious Beloved&mdash;I was. How frightful my blemishes, which
must stink in His nostrils! Think of it! To stink in the nostrils of the
Beloved! What lover could endure to do such a thing? No effort could be too
great or painful to beautify oneself for Him. In this there is no virtue; it is
the driving necessity of love, a necessity known by every lover worthy of the name on earth. To please and obey
this ineffable and exquisite Being!&mdash;the privilege intoxicated me more and more.</p>
<p>All these changes in my heart and mind continually filled me
with surprise, for I was never pious, though inwardly and secretly I had so
ardently sought Him. I was attentive, humble, and reverent, nothing more.</p>
<p>But though I had perhaps little or no piety, and never read a
single religious book, I had had a deep thirst for the perfect and the holy and
the pure, as I seemed unable to find them here on the earth. In the quiet
solemnity of church, or under the blue skies, I could detach myself from my
surroundings and reach up and out with wistful dimness towards the ineffable
holiness and purity of God&mdash;God who, for me at least, remained persistently so
unattainable.</p>
<p>And yet one blessed day I was to find Him suddenly, all in one glorious hour, no longer
unattainable but immanently, marvellously near, and willing to remain for me so
strangely permanently near that I must sing silently to Him from my heart all
the day long&mdash;sing to Him silently, because even the faintest whisper would feel
too gross and loud between my soul and Him. And in hours when I fall from this
wonderful estate I think I come very near hell, so awful is my loss.</p>
<p>Our greatest need is to relearn the will of God. For we are so
separated from Him that we now look upon His Will as on a cross, as an
incomprehensible sacrifice, as but self-abnegation, pain, and gloom. We
repudiate it in terror.</p>
<p>If we have the will to relearn His Will, we stand still and
think of it, we walk to seek it, we try to accept it, trembling we bow down to
it with obedience and many tears; and behold! it changes to an Invitation, a
sigh of beauty, a breath of spring, the song of birds, the faces of
flowers, the ever-ascending spiral of the mating of all loves, the sunshine of
the Universe; and at last, intoxicated with happiness, we say: &quot;My God, my
Love, I sip and drink Thy Will as an ambrosial Wine!&quot;</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>To the lover of God all affections go up and become enclosed, as
it were, into one affection, which is Himself; so that we have no love for
anyone or anything <i>apart </i>from Him. In this is included, in a most deep
and mysterious fashion, marriage-love in all its aspects. In every way it can
become a sacrament: there is nothing in it which is not holy, in no way does the
marriage bond of the body separate the spirit from acceptableness to God.</p>
<p>But I was some time before I could arrive at this, and could see
marriage as the physical prototype in this physical world of the spiritual union with Himself in the spiritual world. And this was arrived at,
not by prudish questionings and criticisms, but by remembering that this
relationship between men and women is His thought, His plan, not ours. We are
responsible for our part in it only in so far as to keep the bond of it pure and
clean and sweet, and submit ourselves in all things <i>as completely and orderly
as possible to His plans, whatever they may be. </i>In this attitude of
unquestioning, unresisting submission, the Holy Spirit finds a swift and easy
channel through us. It is our opposition to the passage of the Holy Will which
causes all the distress and uneasiness of life. He has no wish to impose
distress and suffering upon us. His Will towards us is pure joy, pure love, pure
peace, pure sweetness. This bond of earthly marriage is of the flesh and can be
kept by the body, and yet the heart, mind, and soul remain in lovely perfect
chastity; and I found that this exquisite freedom&mdash;after prolonged endeavours on the part of the
soul and the creature&mdash;was at length given them as a gift by act of grace, and
remained in permanence without variation.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>We know that these things are deep mysteries and largely hidden;
but this I know: as the heart feels love in itself for God, in that same instant
comes God into the soul of the lover. Now, where God is we know that there is
neither evil, nor sadness, nor unhappiness, nor any recollection of such things;
therefore, to be a great and constant lover to Him is to be automatically lifted
from all unhappinesses.</p>
<p>This is our wisest and our best desire, to be a splendid lover
to our Most Glorious God.</p>
<p>The more I see of and talk with other people, the more I see how
greatly changed I am. I am <i>freed. </i>They are bound. I find them bound by fears, by anxieties, by worries, by apprehensions of evil
things, by sadness, by fears of death for their loved ones or for themselves.
Now, we are freed of all these things <i>if we keep to the Way, </i>which is the
Road of Love. This change we do not bring about for ourselves, and do not
perhaps even realise that it can be effected. For myself, I seemed to be lifted
into it, or into a <i>capacity </i>for it, on that day and in that moment in
which I first loved God. This is not to say that since that moment I have not
had to struggle, suffer, and endure, to keep myself in, and progress in this
condition; but my sufferings, struggles, and endurances, being for love and in
love and because of love, were and are in themselves beautiful, and leave in the
recollection nothing inharmonious. They are the difficult prelude to a glorious
melody.</p>
<p>Another thing&mdash;we become by this love for Him so large that we
seem to embrace within our own self the Universe! In some mysterious manner we become in sympathy
with all things in the bond of His making. </p>
<p>Are these things worth nothing
whatever, that the majority of people should be content to spend their lives
looking for five-pound notes and even shillings&mdash;and this not only the poor, but
the rich more so? I am far more at a loss to understand my fellow-men than I am
to understand God. We have need of the shillings, but of other and more lovely
things besides, which cost no money and may be had by the poorest. It is rapidly
becoming the only sorrow of my life that people do not all come to share this
Life in which I live. How that parable knocks at the heart, &quot;Go out into the
highways and the hedges and compel them to come in!&quot; To know all this <i>
fullness </i>of life and not to be able to bring even my nearest and dearest
into it: what a terrible mystery is this!&mdash;it is an agony. Now, in this agony I
share the Agony of Jesus. This is a part of the Cross, and only the Father can make it straight. I
see Heaven held out, and <i>refused; </i>love held out, and <i>refused; </i>
perfection shown, and killed upon a cross. What is the crucifix but that most
awful of all things&mdash;the Grief of God made Visible? Perfect Love submitting
itself to the vile freewill of man and dying of wounds! My God! my God! and did
<i>I</i> ever have a hand in such a thing? I did.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>What is it that seems more than any other thing whatever to
throw us at last into the arms of God? Suffering. And this not because it is His
will (for how much rather would He have us turn to Him in our joy and
prosperity), but rather that it is <i>our </i>will, that in our earthly joys and
prosperities we turn away from Him, and only seek His consolations when we see
the failure of our health or happiness. And having by His mercy and forgiveness
found Him, we too often and too easily think to glorify ourselves and name each
other saints! Did Jesus call us saints? These glorifications mankind would
appear to bestow upon itself. He spoke of His flock, and of those who through
Him should have life eternal, and of those who, because of the road they take,
have their joys in this world only.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>When I was being taught to pray for national things and for
other persons, and found these prayers answered, I was inclined to be afraid;
thinking, What am I that I should dare to petition the Most High? But He showed
it me so, which, as in everything, is for all of us: &quot;It is but a cloud which
reflects the glories of the promise of My rainbow; so can the dust, such as
thyself, reflect yet other fashions of My will and glory. There is no
presumption in the cloud that it should glow with My power; neither is there
presumption in thy dust that it should be My vehicle. Both the cloud and thy dust are Mine.&quot;</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>As we progress in this new way of living we find an increasing
difficulty in maintaining petition; for on commencing to petition we will almost
invariably be instantly lifted up to such a state of adoration that the whole
soul is nothing but a burning song, a thing of living worship. At first I was
inclined to blame myself, but now I know that it is acceptable for us to pass
from petitioning (no matter who or what for) to high adoration, even though it
is a great personal indulgence (and the petitioning is a <i>hard task)&mdash;</i>an
indulgence so extreme that I cannot call to my mind anything in any experience
or time of my life, excepting actual raptures, which could, or can, in any way
compare or be named in the same breath with this most marvellous joy; for out of
this joy of adoration flows the Song of the Soul.</p>
<p>And all these previous years of my life I have lived with the
greater part of me dead, and most persons the same! The more I think of it, the
more amazed I am at our folly&mdash;working and fretting, and striving and looking for
every kind of thing except the one thing, beautiful, needful, and living, which
is the finding of the personal connection between ourselves and God and the
Waters of Life.</p>
<p>Looking to my own experiences, I see clearly how I never could
have found without the most powerful and incessant assistance. We are, then,
never alone. But first we must have <i>the will to seek these waters. </i>This
is the secret of the whole matter. He can turn the vilest into a pure lover&mdash;if
the vilest be willing to have the miracle performed on him! This is the grace of
God, and what does it cost Him to pour out this mighty power through us? For
everything has its price. My Lord! my Lord! we are not worthy of it all.</p>
<p>This I notice, that when He removes this grace, very shortly the
mind goes back to a false, uneven, inharmonious state; so we become like an
instrument all out of tune, and are caused indescribable sufferings, like a
musician whose ears and nerves are tortured by false notes, whilst his unmusical
neighbours feel no pain! The musician pays a price for the privilege of his
great gift; so the lover of Christ.</p>
<p>Again, there is a price to pay for the immeasurable <i>joy</i> of
prayer, for prayers are not always sweet nor life-giving. The prayers to Christ
are always a refreshment, but prayers to the Father may suddenly be turned
without any previous thought or private intention into a most awful grief for
the abominations of the whole world of us, a terrible wordless burnt-sacrifice
of the soul, of unspeakable anguish. And high petitioning is a fearful and
profound strain upon the soul and the whole creature.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>We say that we have need of the purification and conversion of
the soul; but rather it is first the conversion of the heart, mind, and will
that we have need of. For this would feel to be the drama of our life&mdash;the human
heart, intelligence, and will are the ego of the creature. Our soul is the
visitor within this creature, containing within herself a pure, holy, and
incorruptible sparkle of the Divine, and lies choked and atrophied in her human
house until revived and awakened by her holy lover; and this awakening is not
given to her till the heart and mind of her human house (or the will and spirit
of the creature) is in a state of regeneration, or condition to go forward
towards God. Which is to say, the creature has been touched by repentance and a
desire for the pure and the holy. For if the soul should be awakened to an
unrepentant creature, this Will and imperishable worm of the creature (which is
of greater coarseness and lustiness than the delicate and fragile soul) will overcome the soul; and
this is not the goal, neither is the death of the creature the goal, but the
lifting up of the creature into the Divine&mdash;this is the goal.</p>
<p>After being awakened, then, in her human house, the soul finds
herself locked in with two most treacherous and soiled companions&mdash;the human
heart and mind; and so great is her loathing and her distress, that for shame's
sake these two are constrained to improve themselves. But their progress is
slow, and now comes a long and painful time of alternation between two states.
At one time the soul will conquer the creature, imposing upon it a sovereign
beauty of holiness; and at another the creature will conquer the soul, imposing
upon her its hideous designs and desires, and causing her many sicknesses. Hence
we have the warring which we feel within ourselves, for the soul now desires her
home and the creature its appetites.</p>
<p>Until this awakening of the soul takes place, we mistake in
thinking that we either live with our soul, or know our soul, or feel with our
soul. She does but stir within us from time to time, awaking strange echoes that
we do not comprehend; and we live with the mind and the heart and the body
only&mdash;which is to say, we live as the creature; and this is why on the complete
awakening of the soul we feel in the creature an immense and altogether
indescribable enhancement of life and of all our faculties, so that in great
amazement we say, &quot;I have never <i>lived </i>until this day.&quot; When first the
will of the creature is wholly submitted to the lovely guidance of the divine
part of the soul, then first we know the ineffable joys of the world of free
spirit. For to live with the mind and the body is to be in a state of existence
in nature. But to live with the soul is to live above nature, in the
immeasurable freedom and intensity of the spirit. And this is the tremendous task of the soul&mdash;that she help to redeem the heart
and mind from their vileness of the creature and so lift the human upwards with
herself to the Divine from whence she came. This, then, is the transmutation or
evolution by divine means of the human into the divine; and for this we need to
seek repentance or change of heart and mind, which is the will of the creature
turning itself towards the beauties of the spirit, that Christ may awaken in us
the glories of that sleeping soul which is His bride.</p>
<p>When the soul is fully revived we can know it by this, that we
are not able any longer to content ourselves with anything nor anyone save God.
Neither are we able to love any save God, for all human desires and loves
mysteriously ascend and are merged into the Divine. So, though we love our
friend, we love him in God, and in every man perceive but another lover for the
Beloved.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>To love God might commence to be expressed as being a great
quiet, an intense activity, a prodigious joy, and the poignant knowledge of <i>
the immensity of an amazing new life shared</i>.</p>

<p>The contemplation of God might be expressed as the folding up or
complete forgetfulness of all earthly and bodily things, desires, and
attractions, and the raising of the heart and mind and the centring of them in
great and joyful intensity upon God, by means of love. Of this contemplation of
God I find two principal forms: the passive and the active. In the first we are
in a state of steady, quiet, and loving perception and reception, and at some
farness; in this we are able to remain for hours, entering this state when
waking at dawn and remaining in it till rising.</p>
<p>In active contemplation we are in rapturous and passionate
adoration with great nearness, and are not able to remain in it long because of
bodily weakness. The soul feels to be never tired by the longest
flight, but must return because of the exhaustion of the forlorn and wretched
creature, which creature is complete in itself, having its body, of which, being
able to touch it, we say, &quot;It is my body,&quot; and its heart and mind with
intelligence, of which we are wont to think, &quot;This is myself&quot;; yet it is but a
part, for the intelligence of our creature is by no means the intelligence of
the divine soul, but a far lesser light: for with the intelligence of the divine
soul we reach out to God and attain Him, but with the intelligence of the
creature we reach towards Him but do not attain, for with it we are unable to
penetrate the veil. Therefore, who would know the joys of contemplation must
come to them by love, for love is the only means by which the creature can
attain. The soul attains God as her birthright, but the creature by adoption and
redemption, and this through love. By love the creature dies and is reborn into the spirit.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>The word &quot;poverty,&quot; as used to express a necessary condition of
our coming to God, is a most misleading term. For how can any condition be
rightly named poverty which brings us into the riches of God? Rather let us use
the words &quot;singleness of heart,&quot; or &quot;simplicity&quot;: which is to say, we <i>put
out </i>all other interests save those pleasing to God (to commence with), and
afterwards we reach the condition in which we <i>have no </i>interests but in
God Himself&mdash;the heart and mind and will of the creature becoming wholly God's,
and God filling them. How can we say, then, that it is poverty to be filled with
God! Rather is it rightly expressed as being a heart fixed in singleness upon
God, through drastic simplification of interests: the which is no poverty, but
the wealth of all the Universe.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Some of us seem open to suggestion, others to the steadier
effects of personal influence. I never came under the personal influence of
another except once, when I came under the influence of the being I loved
most&mdash;my brother. At ten he saved my life from drowning, and at eighteen his
influence and total lack of faith in God, coupled with the searchings and
probings of my own intelligence, took me away from God, in whom I had previously
had a comfortable faith. At seventeen I began to lap up the hardest scientific
books as a cat laps milk. I said to myself, &quot;I must find truth, I must find out
what everything really is&quot;; but I could not reconcile science with Church
teaching. I was not able to adjust the truths of science&mdash;which were demonstrable
to both senses and intelligence&mdash;with the unprovable dogmas set forth by the
Church as necessary to salvation. I slowly and surely lost what faith I had, and
hung a withered heart upon the pitiless and nameless bosom of the
Cosmos. Inward life became for me a horrible emptiness without hope. Surrounded
with gaieties and the innumerable social successes of youth, I found that
neither science nor society could satisfy my soul, or that something living
within me which knew a terrible necessity for God. For two long and dreadful
years I fought secretly and desperately to regain this lost belief, and when at
last I succeeded there remained a monstrous and impenetrable wall between myself
and God. But by comparison with the horrors of past loneliness it was heaven to
me to feel Him there, even behind that wall. (Now that I have found Him by love,
I am able to return to science as to a most exquisite unrolling of the majesty
of His truths and powers and laws, and am brought nearer and nearer to Him the
more I learn of science.) Outside the wall I remained for more than twenty years, seeking and searching for an opening in that mighty
barrier.</p>
<p>And after more than twenty years I found the Door&mdash;and it was
Jesus Christ.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Lately I have seen the word &quot;contemplation&quot; used as expressing
the heights of attainment in God-consciousness of men, and I find it inadequate.
From the age of seventeen I fell into the habit of contemplation, not of God,
but of Nature: which is to say, I would first place myself, sitting, in such a
position that my body would not fall and I might completely forget it, and then
would look about me and drink in the beauty of the scene, my eyes coming finally
to rest upon the spot most beautiful to me. There they remained fixed. All
thoughts were now folded up so that my mind, flowing singly in one direction,
concentrated itself upon the beauty on which I gazed. This soon vanished, and I
saw nothing whatever, but, bearing away into a place of complete silence and
emptiness, I there assimilated and enjoyed inwardly the soaring essence of the
beauty which I had previously drawn into my mind through my eyes, being now no
longer conscious of seeing outwardly, but living entirely from the inward. This
I did almost every day, but to do it I was obliged to seek solitude, and
absolute solitude is a hard thing to find; but I sought it, no matter where,
even in a churchyard! I saw no graves. I saw the sky, or a marvellous cloud pink
with the kisses of the sun, and away I went. I judge this now to have been
contemplation, though I never thought of it by so fine-sounding a name; it was
only my delightful pastime, yet there was a strange inexpressible sadness in it.
Nature and beauty were not enough. The more beauty I saw, the more I longed for
something to which I could not put a name. At times the ache of this pain became terrible, almost agonising, but I could not
forgo my pastime. Now, at last, I know what this pain was: my soul looked for
God, but my creature did not know it. For just in this same way we contemplate
God, savouring Him without seeing Him, and being filled to the brim with
marvellous delights with no sadness.</p>
<p>But this condition of contemplation is very far from being the
mountain-top; it is but a high plateau from which we make the final ascent. The
summit is an indescribable contact, and this summit is not one summit but many
summits. Which is to say, we have contact of several separate forms&mdash;that of
giving, that of receiving, and that of immersion or absorption, which <i>at its
highest </i>is altogether unendurable as fire.</p>
<p>Of this last I am able only to say this: that not only is it
inexpressible by any words, but that that which is a state of extreme beatitude
to the soul is death to the creature by excess of joy. Therefore both heart
and mind fear to recall any details of the memory of this highest attainment. I
knew it but once. To know it again would be the death of my body. For more than
two hours (as well as I am able to judge) before coming to this highest
experience, my soul travelled through what felt to be an ocean, for she rose and
fell upon billows in a state of infinite bliss.</p>
<p>Of other forms of contact we have a swift, unexpected, even
unsought-for attainment, which is entirely of His volition; that sudden
condescension to the soul, in which in unspeakable rapture she is caught up to
her holy lover.</p>
<p>These are the topmost heights which the creature dare recall, though to the
soul they remain in memory as life itself. The variations of these forms of
contact are infinite, for God would seem to will to be both eternal changelessness and variation in infinitude.</p>
<p>Because of this, and the marvellous depths and heights and
breadths of life revealed to her, the soul is able to conceive of an eternity of
bliss, for monotony ceases to be joy. In Nature we see that no two trees in a
forest are alike, and two fruits gathered from one bough have not the same
flavour.</p>
<p>But to my feeling all degrees of attainment are only to be
distinguished as varying degrees of union, the joy of which is of a form and a
degree of intensity and purity which can enter neither the heart nor the mind to
imagine, but must be experienced to be understood, and when experienced remains
in part incomprehensible. It is not to be obtained by force of the will, neither
can it be obtained without the will. It is, then, a mystery of two wills in
unison, in which our will is temporarily fused into and consumed by the will of
God and is in transports of felicity over its own annihilation! This is outside
reason and therefore incomprehensible to the creature, but comprehensible to the
soul, and becomes the aim and object of our life to attain in permanence, and is
the uttermost limit of all conceivable rapture.</p>
<p>When I first knew union and contact upon the hill I had the
impression of a very great light outside of me. I never again had an outward
impression of it.</p>
<p>But when any sense of inward <i>light </i>is felt I consider it
to be a high ecstasy and hard for the body. It is the sweet and gentle touchings
of Christ which are the great and unspeakable comfort of both soul and body.
Inward heat I never felt till many months after my third conversion and more
than four years from my first conversion. This extraordinary sensation, which to
my mind is like a magnetic seething with heat and ravishment of joy, I felt
inwardly only after I had learnt to know a sudden, secret, joyous delight of
love in the soul, which is easiest described as sweetness of love, is from the Christ, and <i>very
frequently </i>given by Him. And some six months after the heat, fire, electric
seething, or however best it may be named, I first knew the song of the soul.
Now, although it is better not to dwell upon the memory of past spiritual joys,
lest we become greedy, and equally wise not to dwell upon the memory of
anguishes, lest we fall into self-pity, which of all emotions is the most sickly
and useless (and our wisest is to live only from hour to hour with all the
sweetness that we can, leaving to Him the choosing of our daily bread, whether
it be high joy or pain), still I confess that I have thought over and compared
these joys sufficiently to know very well which I love the best. Heat of love is
very wonderful, and sweetness is very lovely, and raptures and ecstasies are
outside words; but most beautiful of all is the song of the soul, and this is
when&mdash;in highest adoration&mdash;passing beyond heat, and further than sweetness, the soul goes up alone upon the highest
summit of love, and there like a bird pours out the rapturous and golden passion
of her love. And His Spirit, biding very near, never touches her; for if He
touch, it is at once an ecstasy, and because of the stress of this she would
have neither words nor song with which to rejoice Him.</p>
<p>Oh, the pure happiness of the soul in this wonderful song!</p>
<p>Truly I think it is greater than in the rapture or the ecstasy,
because in these the soul receives, but in the song, mounting right up to Him,
she gives. And now at last we know the fuller meaning of Christ's words where He
says: &quot;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&quot;</p>
<p>Beloved, Thou takest the creature and liftest it up; Thou takest
the creature and liftest it high, so that nevermore can it offend Thee, and the
soul is free to sing of her love. Then is it Thy will that the creature should love Thee? Or is it Thy will that the soul should adore?
Beloved, I know not whether with my heart and mind I most adore Thee, or whether
with my soul I love Thee more. And where is that secret trysting-place of love?
I do not know; for whilst I go there and whilst I return I am blind, and whilst
I am there I am blinded by Love Himself.</p>
<p>O wondrous trysting-place I which is indeed the only
trysting-place of all the world worthy to be named.</p>
<p>For every other love on earth is but a poor, pale counterfeit of
love&mdash;a wan Ophelia, wandering with a garland of sad perished flowers to crown
the dust.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>As the loving creature progresses he will find himself ceasing
to live in things, or thoughts of things or of persons, but his whole mind and
heart will be concentrated upon the thought of God alone. Now Jesus, now the
High Christ, now the Father, but never away from one of the aspects or personalities of God,
though his conditions of nearness will vary. For at times he will be in a
condition of great nearness, at times in a condition of some farness, or, more
properly speaking, of obscurity. He will be in a condition of waiting (this
exceedingly frequent, the most frequent of all); a condition of amazing
happiness; a condition of pain, of desolation at being still upon the earth
instead of with God. He will be in a condition of giving love to God, or a
condition of receiving love, of remembrance and attention. He will be in a
condition of immeasurable glamour, an extraordinary illumination of every
faculty, not by any act of his own, but poured through him until he is filled
with the elixir of some new form of life, and feels himself before these
experiences never to have lived&mdash;he but existed as a part of Nature. But now,
although he is become more united to Nature than ever before, he also is mysteriously drawn apart from her, without being in any
way presumptuous, he feels to be above her, not by any merits but by intention
of Another. He is become lifted up into the spirit and essence of Nature, and
the heavy and more obvious parts of her bind him no more. He is in a condition
of freedom, he is frequently in a condition of great splendour, and is wrapped
perpetually round about with that most glorious mantle&mdash;God-consciousness.</p>
<p>These are man's right and proper conditions. These are the
lovely will of God for us. And too many of us have the will to go<i> </i>
contrary to Him. Oh, the tragedy of it! If the whole world of men and women
could be gathered and lifted into this garden of love! Persuaded to rise from
lesser loves into the bosom of His mighty Love!</p>
<p>For the truly loving soul here on earth there are no longer
heavens, nor conditions of heavens, nor grades, nor crowns, nor angels, nor archangels, nor saints, nor holy
spirits; but, going out and up and on, we reach at last THE ONE, and for
marvellous unspeakably glorious moments KNOW HIM.</p>
<p>This is life: to be in Him and He in us, <i>and know it.</i></p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>These beautiful flights of the soul cannot be taken through
idleness, though they are taken in what would outwardly appear to be a great
stillness. This stillness is but the necessary abstraction from physical
activity, even from physical consciousness; but inwardly the spirit is in a
great activity, a very ferment of secret work. This, to the writer, is
frequently produced by the beautiful in Nature, the spirit involuntarily passing
at sight of beauty into a passionate admiration for the Maker of it. This high,
pure emotion, which is also an <i>intense activity </i>of the spirit, would seem so to etherealise the creature that instantly the delicate
soul is able to escape her loosened bonds and flies towards her home, filled
with ineffable, incomparable delight, praising, singing, and joying in her Lord
and God until the body can endure no more, and swiftly she must return to
bondage in it. But the most wonderful flights of the soul are made during a high
adoring contemplation of God. We are in high contemplation when the heart, mind,
and soul, having dropped consciousness of all earthly matters, have been brought
to a full concentration upon God&mdash;God totally invisible, totally unimaged, <i>and
yet focussed to a centre-point by the great power of love. </i>The soul, whilst
she is able to maintain this most difficult height of contemplation, may be
visited by an intensely vivid perception, inward vision, and knowledge of God's
attributes or perfections, very brief; and this <i>as a gift, </i>for she is not
able to will such a felicity to herself, but being given such she is instantly consumed with adoration, and <i>enters ecstasy</i>.</p>

<p>Having achieved these degrees of progress, the heart and mind
will say: &quot;Now I may surely repose, for I have attained!&quot; And so we may repose,
but not in idleness, which is to say, not without abundance of prayer. For only
by prayer is our condition maintained and renewed; but without prayer, by which
I mean an incessant inward communion, quickly our condition changes and wears
away. No matter to what degree of love we have attained, we need to pray for
more; without persistent but short prayer for faith and love we might fall back
into strange woeful periods of cold obscurity.</p>
<p>To the accomplished lover great and wonderful is prayer; the
more completely the mind and heart are lifted up in it, the slower the wording.
The greater the prayer, the shorter in words, though the longer the saying of
it, for each syllable will needs be held up upon the soul before God, slowly and, as it were, in a
casket of fire, and with marvellous joy. And there are prayers without words,
and others without even thoughts, in which the soul in a great stillness passes
up like an incense to the Most High. This is very pure, great love; wonderful,
high bliss.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>In the earlier stages of progress, when the heart and mind
suffer from frequent inconstancy, loss of warmth, even total losses of love, set
the heart and mind to recall to themselves by reading or thinking some favourite
aspect of their Lord Jesus Christ. It may be His gentleness, or His marvellous
forgiveness, as to Peter when &quot;He turned and looked at him&quot; after the denial;
for so He turns and looks upon ourselves. Or it may be His sweetness that most
draws us. But let us fasten the heart and mind upon whichever it may be, and in
the warmth of admiration <i>love will return to us.</i></p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>The mode of entrance into active contemplation I would try to
convey in this way. The body must be placed either sitting or kneeling, and
supported, or flat on the back as though dead. Now the mind must commence to
fold itself, closing forwards as an open rose might close her petals to a bud
again, for every thought and image must be laid away and nothing left but a
great forward-moving love intention. Out glides the mind all smooth and swift,
and plunges deep, then takes an upward curve and up and on till willingly it
faints, the creature dies, and consciousness is taken over by the soul, which,
quickly coming to the trysting-place, <i>spreads herself </i>and there awaits
the revelations of her God. To my feeling this final complete passing over of
consciousness from the mind to the soul is by act and will of God only, and cannot be performed by will of the creature, and is the
fundamental difference between the contemplation of Nature and the contemplation
of God. The creature worships, but the soul alone knows contact. And yet the
mode of contemplation is a far simpler thing than all these words&mdash;it is the very
essence of simplicity itself; and in this sublime adventure we are really
conscious of no mode nor plan nor flight, nought but the mighty need of spirit
to Spirit and love to Love.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>The picking out and choosing of certain persons, and the naming
of them &quot;elect&quot; and &quot;chosen&quot; souls, when I first read of it, filled me with such
a sinking that I tried, when coming upon the words, not to admit the meaning of
them into myself; for that some should be chosen and some not I felt to be
favouritism, and could not understand or see the justice of it. I never ask
questions. He left me in this condition for eighteen months. Then He led me to an
explanation sufficient for me. The way He showed it me was not by comparisons
with great things&mdash;angels and saints and holy persons; but by that humble
creature, man's friend, the dog, He showed me the elect creature. It was this
way.</p>
<p>One evening as I passed through the city I had one of those
sudden strong impulses (by which He guides us) to go to a certain and particular
cinematograph exhibition. I was very tired, and tried to put away the thought,
but it pressed in the way that I know, and I knew it better to go. I sat for an
hour seeing things that had no interest for me, and wondering why I should have
had to come, when at last a film was shown of war-dogs in training&mdash;dogs trained
especially to assist men and to carry their messages.</p>
<p>These dogs were especially selected, not for their charm of outward appearance, but for their inward capacities; <i>not for an especial
love of the dog </i>(or favouritism), but for that which they were willing to
learn how to do. The qualifications for (s)election were willingness, obedience,
fidelity, endurance. Once chosen they were set apart. Then commenced the
training, and we were shown how man put his will through the dog: he was able to
do this <i>only because of the willingness of the dog. </i>The purport of the
training was to carry a message for his master wherever his master willed. He
must go instantly and at full speed; he must leap any obstacle; he must turn
away from his own kind if they should entice him to linger on the way; he must
subdue all his natural desires and instincts entirely to his master's desires;
he must be indifferent to danger. And to secure this he was fired over by
numbers of men, difficulties were set for him, and he was distracted from his
straight course by a number of tests. Yet we saw the brave and faithful creatures running on their way at their
fullest speed until, exhausted and breathless but filled with joy of <i>love and
willingness, </i>they reached the journey's end, to be caressed and cared for
beyond other dogs until the next occasion should arise. Then we were shown the
dog in his fully-trained condition. His master could now always rely upon him. A
dog always ready, always faithful and self-forgetful, was then set apart into a
still smaller and more (s)elect group and surrounded with most especial care and
love. Never would it want for anything. In this there was justice. Forsaking all
their natural ways, these dogs had submitted themselves wholly, in loving
willingness, to their master's will, and he in return would lavish all his best
on them. It was but just. Oh, how my heart leaped over it! At last I
understood&mdash;for as the dog, so the human creature. We become chosen souls, not
for our own sakes (which had always seemed to me such favouritism), but for our willingness
to learn our Master's Will. And what is His will and what is His work? Of many,
many kinds, and this is shown to the soul in her training. But the hardest to
learn is not that of the worker, but of the messenger and lover. As the
messenger, to take His messages, in whatever direction, instantly and correctly,
and to take back the answer from man to Himself&mdash;which is to say, to hold before
Him the needs of man on the fire of the soul, known to most persons under the
name of prayer. And as the lover, to sing to Him with never-failing joyful
love and thanks.</p>
<p>But the learning and work of the soul is not so simple as that
of the dog, who carries the message in writing upon his collar. The soul can
have no written paper to assist her, and long and painful is her training; and
exquisitely sweet it is when, having swiftly and accurately taken the message, she waits before Him for the rapture of those
caresses that she knows so well.</p>
<p>How I was spurred! For I said, &quot;Shall dogs outdo us in love and
devotion?&quot; Only in a condition of total submission, self-forgetfulness,
self-abnegation, can the soul either receive or deliver her message. In this way
she is justified of the joys of her election. The dog, faithful in all ways to
his master, receives in return all praise and all meats, whatever he desires.
The faithful soul also receives all praise and all meats, both spiritual and
carnal, for nothing of earthly needs will lack her <i>if she asks</i>; and
without asking, her needs are mysteriously and completely given her. Her
spiritual meats are, in this world, peace, joy, ecstasy, rapture; and of the
world to come it is written that eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
entered into the heart of man, the things that God has prepared for them that
love Him.</p>
<p>It might be supposed that only persons filled with public
charities and social improvements, ardent and painstaking church workers, might
most surely and easily learn to be messengers. But all these persons pursue and
follow their own line of thought, the promptings of their own minds and hearts.
They are admirable workers, but not messengers. For the hound of God must have
in his heart no plan of his own. It is hard for the heart to say, &quot;I have no
wishes of my own; I have no interests, no plans, no ambitions, no schemes, no
desires, no loves, no will. Thy will is my will. Thy desire is my desire. Thy
love is my all. I am empty of all things, that I may be a channel for the stream
of Thy will.&quot;</p>
<p>With what patience, what tenderness, what inexpressible
endearments He helps the soul, training her by love!&mdash;which is not to say that
she is trained without much suffering of the creature. So we are trained by two opposite ways&mdash;by suffering and by joys; and the whole under an
attitude of passionate and devoted attention on our part. The sufferings of the
soul baffle all description with their strange intensities.</p>
<p>Our encouragements are great and extraordinary sweetnesses,
urgings, and joyful uplifting of the spirit. So that when we would stop, we are
pressed forward; when we are exhausted, we are filled with the wine of
sweetness; when we are in tears, we are embraced into the Holy Spirit.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Sin and ill are the false notes struck by man across the harmony
of God's will, and to strike upon or even remember such notes is instant
banishment from the music of His presence. Where all is joy, there joy is all<i>;
</i>and he who has not reached this joy does not know God&mdash;he is still a
follower, and not a possessor, and he should refuse in his heart to remain
satisfied with his condition, but climb on. Why stay behind? Climb on,
climb on!</p>
<p>How often I have been mystified and disturbed by the attitude of
many religious and pious people, that to follow Christ is a way of gloom, of
sadness, of heaviness! How often have I gathered from sermons that we are to
give up all bright and enticing things if we would follow Him, and the preacher
<i>goes no further! </i>Has the Lord, then, no enticements, no sweetnesses, no
brightness to offer us, that we should be asked to forsake all pleasantnesses,
all brightness, all attractions if we follow Him? This to me always seemed
terrible, and my heart would sink. Indeed, to my poor mind and heart it seemed
nothing more hopeful than a going from bad to worse!</p>
<p>All the pictures I have seen, either of the Crucifixion or the
Way of the Cross (and especially those of more recent times and painting),
portray His Blessed Face all worn with gloom; and I know now that this is far from the truth. For perfect love
knows agony, but no gloom. He went through all His agony, lifted high above
gloom, in a great ecstasy of love for us.</p>
<p>To speak of <i>sacrifice </i>in connection with following Him
is, to my mind, the work of a very foolish person and one in danger of being
blasphemous. For how dare we say that it is a sacrifice when, by the putting
away of foolish desires, we find God! And to find God, through the following of
Jesus Christ, is to <i>gain so much </i>(even in this world, and without waiting
for the next) that those who gain it never cease to be amazed at the vastness of
it.</p>
<p>We find this to be an absolute truth, that if we have not Him we
have, and are, nothing, in comparison with that which we are and that which we
have when we have Him.</p>
<p>In my earlier stages I was greatly set back and disturbed by
this gloom and sacrifice (which is no sacrifice) of myself so put forward by pulpit teaching. It was a great
hindrance to me and blinded me to the truth. I was only a normal, ordinary
creature, and they thrust a great burden into my arms.</p>
<p>Little by little, as I was able to learn directly from His own
heart, I came to know Him as He is; and I could not reconcile this knowledge of
Himself which He gave me, especially of His high willingness and serenity, with
pulpit teachings of heavy gloom. The Church too frequently spoke to me of
following Him in terms which conveyed a burden: &quot;Pick up thy cross, pick up thy
cross!&quot; they cried; and He spoke to me in terms which conveyed a great joy: &quot;Come to Me, come to Me, for I love thee!&quot;</p>
<p>I thought I was very cowardly and sinned by this inability to
like the gloomy burden, and one day I came upon this out of Jeremiah: &quot;As for
the prophet, or the priest, or the people, that shall say, The burden of the Lord, I will punish
that man and his house . . . because ye say, The burden of the Lord, I will
utterly forget you and forsake you, and cast you out of My presence.&quot;</p>
<p>These words of Jesus, &quot;Take up thy cross and follow Me&quot;:
whoever will do it will be shown by Jesus that the cross of following Him is no
burden, but a deliverance, a finding of life, the way of escape, a great joy,
and a garland of love.</p>
<p>The world thinks of joyousness as being laughter, cackling, and
much silly noise; and to such I do not speak. But the Christ's joyousness is of
a high, still, marvellous, and ineffable completeness&mdash;beyond all words; and <i>
wholly satisfying </i>to heart and soul and body and mind.</p>
<p>It is written, &quot;They shall love silver, and not be satisfied
with it&quot;&mdash;for why? Only those are <i>satisfied </i>who know the gold of Christ.</p>
<p>All of which is not to say that by following Him we shall escape from happenings and inconveniences
and sorrows and illnesses common to life; but that when these come we are raised
out of our distress into His ineffable peace.</p>
<p>When the heart is sad, use this sadness in a comprehension of
the deeper pain of Jesus, who was in the self-same exile as we ourselves. The
more the soul is truly awakened and touched, the more she feels herself to be in
exile; and this is her cross.</p>
<p>But the remedy for her sadness is that she should courageously
pass out of her woes of exile and go up to meet her lover with smiles. Now, He
cannot resist this smiling courage and love of the soul, and very quickly He
must send her His sweetness, and her sadness is gone.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>When I say that if we will take a few steps alone towards
Christ&mdash;which is to say, if we will make some strenuous efforts to
cleanse ourselves and change our minds and ways&mdash;He will take us all the rest of
the way, I speak from experience. For amongst many things this happened to me:
at a certain stage, after my third conversion on the hill, He caused my former
thoughts, desires, and follies to go away from me! It was as though He had sent
a veil between me and such thoughts of my heart and mind as might not be
pleasing to Him, so that they disappeared from my knowledge and my actions!</p>
<p>By this marvellous act He removed my difficulties, and put me
into a state of innocence which resembled the innocence I remember to have had
up to the age of four or five years. But I find this new innocence far more
wonderful than that of childhood, which is but the innocence of ignorance. But
this new innocence&mdash;which is a gift of God&mdash;is innocence with knowledge. I am not
able to express the gratitude and amazement and wonder that have never
ceased to fill me about this. Such things can only be spoken of by the soul to
her lover, and then not in words but in a silence of tears.</p>
<p>What did I ever do that He should show me such kindness? I did
nothing except this: I desired with all the force of my heart and soul and mind
and body to love Him. I said, &quot;Oh, if I could be the warmest, tenderest lover
that ever thou didst have! Teach me to be Thy burning lover.&quot; This was my
perpetual prayer. And my idea of Heaven was and is this, that without so much as
knowing, or being known or perceived by <i>any save Himself, </i>without even a
name, yet retaining my full consciousness of individuality, I should be with Him
for always.</p>
<p>What is this love for God, and how define it? For myself, I
never knew it until I was filled with it upon the hill. Many judge it to be <i>a
following
</i>of Christ and His wishes, but this is only a part of it and the
way we begin it, and often we begin from duty, fear of future punishment, desire
for salvation or spiritual pre-eminence, and obedience; and in none of these is
there the joy of love.</p>
<p>By such standards I might count myself to have loved Him for
twenty years; but know I did not. For ten years past I felt myself to have so
great a need of Him, I sought Him so, that for me Heaven contained no re-met
former earthly loves, much as I loved them here. I knew that He would be my all.
Nevertheless, He was not yet my Love, but my Need.</p>
<p>Love is a fire, for we feel the great heat of it.</p>
<p>Love is a light, for we perceive the white glare of it.</p>
<p>Of things known, to what can we compare it? Most perhaps to
electricity, for here we have both light and heat, and the lightning flash
strikes that which already contains the most of itself (or electricity). And the lightning of God's love
strikes him whose heart contains the most love for Himself. And He strikes when
He will, and afterwards visits when He will; and I do not count myself (for all
my earthly loves) to have so much as known the outer edge of the meaning of the
word love, till He struck me with His own upon that hill.</p>
<p>Truly, fair and holy love is our warranty, our only pass for
entering into Heaven.</p>
<p>Brave and wilful, rapturous and insistent, love passes with bold
yet humble ecstasy into the very presence of her Lord and God; and alone, out of
all creation, is never denied the Right of Way.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>I have seen it quoted, &quot;Turn to the heights, turn to the deeps,
turn within, turn without, everywhere thou shalt find the Cross.&quot; But I see it
so: &quot;Turn to the heights, turn to the deeps, turn within, turn without,
everywhere thou shalt find His Love.&quot; Love to help on the way. Too much we might
suppose, to hear pious people talk, that because of Christ's way we must be
miserable and our life an endless Cross! And so life may be a cross, but He
carries it for us.</p>
<p>Do sinful men never suffer? Do the sinful escape disease? and
live for ever without biting the dust in death or disappointment? Why, disease
and suffering are the very twin-children of sin. I am amazed that people can
take such a view of the Cross as to think it an unhappy, miserable way. For so
marvellous is the beauty of such love that there is no other so desirable a
thing upon earth.</p>
<p>&quot;Come, walk the way with Me,&quot; says the Beloved; &quot;I am all
serenity, all peace, all might, all power, all love. Come, walk with Me, and
forget thy tiny cares in the peace of My bosom.&quot;</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>We do not love God because we do not yet know Him. And we do not know Him because we seek only to
know and have our own desires: and having learnt to know these, we would have
our unknown God accommodate Himself to us and them.</p>
<p>But let us first seek to know God's desires by heart, and then
accommodate our own to His: so shall we learn to be pleasing to Christ, that He
may lead us, whilst here, into His Garden. For to the creature that ardently
pursues God there comes at last a time when He reveals Himself to the searching
soul, saying: &quot;I Am Here. Come!&quot; Then in secrecy we arise,&mdash;and go to Him out
of the House of Vanity into the music of the great Beyond.</p>
<p>There is small credit or virtue to the soul when, in a state of
high grace or nearness, she burns with love for her God: for she is under the
spell of the enticement of His Presence&mdash;how can she help but burn! It is as
though two earthly lovers, in full sight and nearness, are filled each for each with great love, and are
content.</p>
<p>But this is a credit to the soul and the creature (as to the
earthly lovers), that in separation and farness they should seek no other, but
continue to dwell with great intentness upon the absent love. This is fidelity.</p>
<p>At times it is as if her Lord said to the soul: &quot;I have other
to do than to stay by thee; and also thou hast had more than enough to thy share
of My honey&quot;; and, so saying, He departs.</p>
<p>And this is fidelity of the soul and the creature, and a great
virtue, that, without change of face, without complaint or petitioning, they
should with all sweetness continue to pour up to Him their unabated love. If any
can do this, he is a perfect lover and has no more to learn.</p>
<p>When the love of the soul, as it were, exceeds itself, it passes
up and beyond even the song of love; and being unable to express itself by words
or by song, or by deep sighings, or by any of those subtle, silent, spiritual means known only between
herself and God, when all means fail because of the too great stress of her
adoration, then the soul passes into a great pain, which is the anguish of love
and a hard thing to bear. This excess is to the fullness of the Godhead.</p>
<p>And now the soul must turn to prayer for help, but not to the
Godhead: for the more she turns to the Godhead the greater becomes her anguish.
But coming down to His humanity, she must beseech sweet Jesus for His aid, and
so regain her equilibrium.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Many of us are, perhaps unwittingly, impudent to God. In this
way we are impudent: We question (even though it be in secret, hidden in the
heart and not spoken) the justice of God, the ways of God, the plans of God, the
love of God: by which means we argue with God and judge Him. And another manner of impudence we have is this, that we dare to attribute
or to blame Him for the results of man's own filth, saying: &quot;This and this is
the will of God, for we see that it exists, and His will is omnipotent.&quot; Oh,
beware of this impudence, drop it out of the heart and mind, and flee from it as
from the plague! &quot;How then can these things be, if He is omnipotent?&quot; we say.
Because of this, that in the trust of His great love He gave us the royal and
Godly gift of free-will, and our souls have proved themselves unworthy to have
it; and now the creature is brought before the Beautiful, and the Holy, and the
Pure, but turning away, like the sow, prefers the mire and the festering sores
proceeding from such wallowings. If there were no choice, there were no virtue,
and no progress home. But let no man venture in his heart to attribute to that
Holy and Marvellous Being whom we speak of as God, not knowing as yet His Name,
any will towards festers and corruptions, for what does He say Himself? &quot;Their sins rise up before
Me and stink in My nostrils!&quot;</p>
<p>We surely forget that this world is not yet God's Kingdom, and
that His will is not done here, and will not be until the Judgment Day. This
world is but a tiny testing-chamber in His mighty workshop; and great and
wonderful is the care He has for the workers in it.</p>
<p>O man! whence come thy wretchednesses? Look round and think. Do
they not all proceed from self and fellow-men, alive or dead? Then why blame
God?</p>
<p>&quot;Why am I here?&quot; we cry, &quot;to suffer all these pains, and my
consent not asked? A poor, sad puppet dancing to a tune I know not the rhythm
of. Where is my recompense? And where my wages? I will take all I can of what is
offered here, and give no thanks! It is but my scant due for all my
wretchednesses!&quot;</p>
<p>O foolish man! so timid of all future possibilities of bliss that he must grasp and burn himself with
such delights as he finds here! And equally mistaken and small-minded man who
thinks that all our Mighty God will have to offer us hereafter are crowns, damp
clouds and mists, and endless hymns! Such little hearts are far away indeed from
knowing the <i>magnitudes of Life</i>.</p>

<p>O wretched man! why this distrust? Hast thou created even thine
own palate and digestion? Hast thou invented any of those fond delights that so
enslave thee now? Hast thou thyself devised the means wherewith to satisfy the
longing of thy <i>creature </i>for the sweets of life? They were provided thee;
all that thou hast created is misuse! Thou art but a perverted thing!&mdash;a crooked
tool of self, a fly drowning in the honey that it sought too greedily to own!</p>
<p>O wretched, wretched man! so cloyed with sweets of earth thou
canst not raise thy head to see the sunrise out beyond the world, and know true sweets! How many are the tears
wept over thee by the great heart of God!</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Since coming into this new way of living, the more I come into
contact with music the more I sense a mysterious connection between melody&mdash;the
soul&mdash;and her <i>origin. </i>Alone out of all the sciences and arts, music has no
foundation upon anything on earth. There is no music in nature until the soul,
come to a perfect harmony within herself, brings out the hidden harmony in all
creation, and, turning it to melody within herself, returns it to her Lord in
song, whether by outward instrument or inward love.</p>
<p>The soul, indeed, would seem to have come out of a life of
infinite melody and to have dropped into an existence of mere contrary and
vexing time-beat.</p>
<p>Who can by any means account for the variety of passions excited
within him by the mere difference of the spacing, time, or rhythm of
music? In my new condition of living I notice that the soul throws out with most
disdainful impatience music that was formerly beautiful to my mind and heart (or
my creature); and certain types of flowing cadences (very rarely to be found),
sustained in high, flowing, delicate, and soaring continuity will produce in her
conditions akin to a madness of joy. For one brief instant <i>she remembers!
but cannot utter what</i>!</p>

<p>Of visions I know nothing, but received all my experiences into
my soul as amazingly real inward perceptions. That these perceptions are of
unprecedented intensity, and more realistic than those which are merely visual,
can be understood by bodily comparisons; for to <i>feel </i>or to be one with
fire is more than to <i>see </i>it.</p>
<p>To try to compare spiritual life with physical experiences would
seem to be useless; for, to my feeling, while we live in the spirit we live at a
great speed,&mdash;indeed, an incalculably great speed&mdash;and as a whole and
not in parts. For with physical living we live at one moment by the eyes, at
another with the mind, at another through the heart, at another with the body.
But the spirit feels to have no parts, for all parts are of so perfect a
concordance that in this marvellous harmony all is one and one is all. And this
with <i>incredible intensity, </i>so that we live not as now&mdash;dully&mdash;but at white
heat of sensibility.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Prayer</i></p>

<p>Prayer is the golden wedding-ring between ourselves and God. For
myself, I divide it into two halves&mdash;the one petitioning, the other offering.</p>
<p>Of petitioning I would say that this is the <i>work </i>of the
soul; and of offering, that it is the pleasure of the soul.</p>
<p>Of petitioning, that I come to it under His command; and of
offering, that I come to it of my own high, passionate desire.</p>
<p>I make upon my knees, three times a day, three short and formal
prayers of humble worship, as befits the creature worshipping its Ineffable and
Mighty God: and for the rest of my time I sing to Him from my heart and soul, as
befits the joyful lover, adoring and conversing with the Ineffable and Exquisite
Beloved.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>This is the circle of His way with us. First is prayer; then
love; and after love, humility. With humility comes grace; and after grace,
temptation; and in temptation we must quickly enter prayer again.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>O wonderful and ineffable God! who, while remaining hidden from
His lovers in this life, yet so ravishes their hearts and minds and souls that
they are unable to find truly sweet even the greatest of life's former joys&mdash;for
nothing can now ever satisfy them but the secret and marvellous administrations of His love and grace! On one day feeling to be
forsaken, the most desolate and lonely of all creatures in the Universe; and on
another exalted to almost unbearable pinnacles of bliss, equal to the angels in
felicity, and blest beyond all power of words to say&mdash;such and so are the lovers
of God.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>The soul has six wings: love, obedience, humility, simplicity,
perseverance, and courage. With these she can attain God.</p>
<p>We know very well that no man will find God either enclosed,
held fast, or demonstrated within a circle of dogmatic words; but every man can
find, in his own soul, an exquisite and incomparable instrument of communication
with God. To establish the working of this communication is the whole object and
meaning of life in this world&mdash;this world of material, finite, and physical
things, in which the human body is at once a means and a debt.</p>
<p>The key to progress is a continual dressing of the will and mind
and heart towards God, best brought about by continually filling the heart and
mind with beautiful, grateful, and loving thoughts of Him. At all stages of
progress the thoughts persistently fly away to other things in the near and
visible world, and we have need quietly and perpetually to pick them up and
re-centre them on Him. With the mind turned in this way, steadily towards God,
we are in that state known to science as polarisation: we are in that condition
in which common iron becomes a magnet. It is so that God transforms us into a
diminutive part-likeness of Himself.</p>
<p>When at last the soul reaches union with Him, she is for a while
so caressed, so held in a perpetual contact and nearness, that we may think
ourselves already permanently entered into Paradise! But this is not the plan; and, our education being exceedingly incomplete,
we return to our schooling.</p>
<p>We commence to experience profound and even terrible longings to
leave the world and all creatures, for we cannot bear either the sight or the
sound of them, and seek all day long to be alone with the Beloved God. To
conquer this last selfishness and weakness of the soul, we must go again&mdash;as in
the beginning&mdash;to Jesus. He teaches us to go to and fro <i>willingly, </i>gladly,
from the highest to the lowest. To pick up our daily life and duties, our
obligations to a physical world, in all humility, sweet reasonableness, and
submission. He teaches us to willingly accept incessant interruptions, and with
smiling face and perfect inward smoothness to descend from a high contemplation
of God (and only those who know high contemplation can judge of the immensity of
what I say) to listen and <i>attend to </i>some most trivial want of a fellow-creature! Reader, it is the hardest thing of all. No
sooner have we learnt the hard and difficult way of ascent than we must
willingly come down it, even remain altogether in the valley below, and that
with a smiling face and, if possible, no thought of impatience! This is the true
sacrifice of the soul. Now, the sacrifices of the creature are the giving up of
the near and visible joys and prides of the world to follow Christ, and are not
real but seeming sacrifices, for, if done heartily and with courage, an exchange
between these joys and the joys of the invisible is rapidly effected, and there
remains no sacrifice, but &quot;the hidden treasure&quot; is ours! But the sacrifice of
the soul is real and long; for having at last re-found God, she must resign her
full joy of Him till the death of the body&mdash;and this willingly, thankfully,
without complaint, not asking favours but pouring up her gratitude. In joy or in
pain, in happiness or in tribulation&mdash;gratitude! gratitude!&mdash;and this not by her own strength but by
strength of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Because of this new way of living, the mind acquires a great
increase of capacity and strength and clearness: being able to deal quickly and
correctly with all matters brought before it with an ease previously altogether
unknown to its owner. It is no exaggeration to say that the sagacity, scope, and
grasp of the mind feels to be more than doubled from that which it previously
was, and this not because of any study, but by an involuntary alteration. So
that, though the mind and attention are now given almost exclusively to the
things of God, yet when the things of the world have to be dealt with, this is
accomplished with extraordinary efficiency and quickness, though very
distasteful to the mind.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>As the soul returns to her source nothing is more strongly
emphasised to her than the strength and intensity of individuality; she is shown
that the essence of all joy is Individuality in Union.</p>
<p>In the marvellous condition of Contact, though we cease to be
the creature or the soul adoring the Creator (but by an incomprehensible
condescension we are accepted as one with Himself in love), yet we retain our
own consciousness, which is our individuality.</p>
<p>In the highest rapture I ever was in, my soul passed into a
fearful extremity of experience: she was burned with so terrible an excess of
bliss, that she was in great fear and anguish because of this excess. Indeed,
she was so overcome by this too great realisation of the strength of God that
she was in terror of both God and joy. It was three days before she recovered
any peace, and more than a year before I dared recall one instant of it to mind.</p>
<p>I am not able to think that even in Heaven the soul could endure
such heights for more than a period. These heights are incomparably, unutterably
beyond vision and union. They are the uttermost extremity of that which can be
endured by the soul, at least until she has re-risen to great altitudes of
holiness in ages to come.</p>
<p>By contact with God we acquire certain wonderful and terrible
realisations of truth and knowledge. For one thing, we learn the nature and mode
of spirit-life, as over against body- or sense-life. We learn, at first with
great fear, something of the awful intensities of pain, as of joy, which can be
endured by the spirit when free of the body: for when we are in the spirit we do
not <i>see </i>fire, but we feel to <i>become it </i>and yet live! And so
equally of pain or joy&mdash;we do not feel these things delicately, as with, and in,
the body, but we pass into the essence of these things themselves, in all their terrible and marvellous intensity, which is
comparatively without limit.</p>
<p>Woe to those who must gather the garland of pain&mdash;which is
remorse-after death! It is easier to suffer a whole lifetime in the body than
one day in the spirit. O soul! come to thy contrition here in this world, where
pain has short limit! Repent and return!</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Of the marvellous favours shown to the soul the heart cries out:
&quot;O mighty God! of the magnitude of Thy condescensions I am afraid even to
think; they are too great for me, and I dare to recall them, but only with all
the simplicity of a little child!&quot;</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>Those who feel desire and need within themselves to reach the
heights of inward life will do it best, not through diversity of interests in
fellow-creatures, but by unification of all interests in God.</p>
<p>God once found, and possessed, we return to the interests of
creatures in moderation and with judgment.</p>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>What is pain? It is a mystery of separation, and we are
gangrenous with sin and pain because of separation from the source of life.</p>
<p>Truth now comes to us in such small segments that we no longer
see the pattern of it; but this we are able to perceive: that the mystery of
Separation is equal in degree with the mystery of Union, and that the child of
separation is Pain.</p>
<p>How did the soul ever become so separated from God? To my
feeling, in curiosity of loves we may find the answer, and know the &quot;fall&quot; to
be not that of the animal man but of the soul, which, once living in perpetual
beatitude&mdash;knowing nothing of pain because of the unity with God, not
understanding or being even grateful for her bliss because of its invariable presence, and given free-will,&mdash;in curiosity went out in search
of newer and yet newer loves. And this is the retribution of the soul for her
unfaithful wanderings&mdash;that as separation grows greater she commences to know
pain, and, becoming anxious therefrom to return to the source of her remembered
joys, she finds herself unable to accomplish this because of the weight and
grossness of the nature of the loves to which she has hired herself, and from
which <i>she is totally unable to free herself, </i>and yet which she must by
some means overcome that she may rise again to sanctity and return to God.</p>
<p>Now comes the marvellous, the pitiful, the universal Christ to
her aid&mdash;the Mighty Lover; and we may see in the whole scheme of Creation, as we
know it here, from jelly-fish to man, a plan by which the soul may bring her
wanderings to a term in time conditions instead of timeless sons. When all this
earth is evolved for her great need, at last by the mercy of God she is interned
in the body of finite man, and must clothe herself in the heart and mind of the
human and take upon herself the nature of this creature man, made and fashioned
to be a suitable instrument and habitation for her. To counterbalance the
grossness and ineptitude of the creature's material body with its appetites, man
is imbued with the knowledge of right, and with a secret longing for a <i>
happiness which is not that of the beast</i>.</p>

<p>The soul must raise the brute in him, with all its appetites, to
purity,&mdash;a mighty task, accomplished with much pain, yet in infinitely shorter
duration of pain than if left in disembodied spirit-life; and, indeed, we may
come to look upon pain in this world as one of our best privileges because of
its powers of purification within a time-limit, and to know that by the mercy of
the God of Love we may take our hell of cleansing in this world rather than in those worlds of disembodied spirits where
progress is of infinite slowness&mdash;revolving and revolving upon itself, as a
sand-spiral in a blast-furnace, without hope of death.</p>
<p>Oh, how convey any warning of this terrible knowledge, which is
not communicable by words! He said, &quot;Though one return from the dead, ye would
not believe.&quot; But, O soul! repent and return while still in the body! Lay hold
on the Christ!</p>
<p>In the life of this world, then, does our God of love and mercy
give us rapid means (by conquest of the animal grossness and corruptible body,
raising man to the ideal man, according to God's intention) to reunite ourselves
with Him. And the soul of all animal creation is also thereby gradually raised
with us into a universal adoration of the One Almighty God.</p>
<p>This is no fallen but a rising world, in which all Creation is
slowly and gloriously rising step by step.</p>
<p>So may our soul repay her debt to God for her past infidelities.</p>
<p>&quot;Thy Maker is thine husband,&quot; says the voice of the prophet.</p>
<p>And the creature, with its suffering heart and mind and body,
has also its incomparable reward of bliss: for because of its love and obedience
it is raised into the spiritual body, AND TOGETHER WITH THE SOUL BECOMES THE
CHILD OF THE RESURRECTION.</p>
